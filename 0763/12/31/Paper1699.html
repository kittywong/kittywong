<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Florian Thamm, Oliver Taubmann, Felix Denzinger, Markus Jürgens, Hendrik Ditt, Andreas Maier Abstract By injecting contrast agent during a CT acquisition, the vascular system can be enhanced. This acquisition type is known as CT Angiography (CTA). However, due to typically lower dose levels of CTA scans compared to non-contrast CT acquisitions (NCCT) and the employed reconstruction designed specifically for vessel reconstruction, soft tissue contrast in the brain parenchyma is usually subpar. Hence, an NCCT scan is preferred for the visualization of such tissue. We propose SyNCCT, an approach which synthesizes NCCT images from the CTA domain by removing enhanced vessel structures and improving soft tissue contrast. Contrary to virtual non-contrast (VNC) images based on dual energy scans, which target the physically accurate removal of iodine rather than generating a realistic NCCT with improved gray/white matter separation, our approach only requires a conventional single-energy acquisition. By design, our method integrates prior domain knowledge and employs residual learning as well as a discriminator to achieve perceptual realism. In our data set of patients with ischemic stroke, the absolute differences in automatic ASPECT scoring, which rates early signs of an occlusion in the anterior circulation on a scale from 0 (most severe) to 10 (no signs), was 0.78 +- 0.75 (median of 1) when comparing our SyNCCT to the real NCCT images. Qualitatively, realistic appearance of the images was confirmed by means of a Turing test with a radiologist, who classified 64% of 64 (32 real, 32 generated) images correctly. Two other physicians classified 65% correctly, on average.

Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html It is quite interesting to see a new application of using GAN Fig. 1 is a little confusing. cannot understand the approach only relying on this figure. It is not clear why VNC -EST is needed to train GAN if this estimation only maps CTA HU to CT HUS. DO you think the network cannot learn this nonlinear HU mapping? Turing test showed some positive signals of fake NCCT. but not good enough. It is more interesting to see how many fake NCCT considered as real, or vice verse. using automated ASPECTS software as a tool to evaluate the performance is not convincing . I do not think current ASPECTS software are accurate enough to be ground truth. It is better to ask radiologists to score ASPECTS on both fake and real NCCT.

What is the ranking of this paper in your review stack? 3 Number of papers in your stack 5 Reviewer confidence Very confident Review #2 Please describe the contribution of the paper The authors propose an approach to derive non-contrast CT images from CTA. Three inputs are fed to a 2D Unet: the CTA, the segmentation of the vessels and a first estimate of the synthetic non-contrast CT obtained by applying a function that approximately maps CTA HU to non-contrast CT HU. A discriminator is used to distinguish fake from real non-contrast CTs. The approach is trained/validated on a dataset of 127 patients and tested on 23 patients, all with ischemic strokes. The evaluation consists of a qualitative analysis, an expert validation (Turing test) and a quantitative analysis. In the quantitative analysis, the image synthesis accuracy is evaluated using the generic SSIM and an application-specific score meant to assess infarction severity. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. Novel application: synthesis of non-contrast CT images from CTA Thorough evaluation: qualitative evaluation + expert evaluation using the Turing test + quantitative evaluation using both generic and application-specific metrics Paper clear and easy to follow Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Very sparse coverage of the related works, only one paper is mentioned. Even though the authors target a novel application, several approaches have been developed for contrast-enhanced to non-contrast (and vice-versa) or low-dose to high-dose image synthesis. The individual contributions of the different inputs have not been evaluated. Several methodological points could be better explained, for example how the function that approximately maps CTA HU to non-contrast CT HU was determined, or why predict the difference between CTA and non-contrast CT instead of the non-contrast CT directly. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Very Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The authors have been honest when filling the reproductibilty checklist. The authors use a private dataset that cannot be shared but its description is reasonable for an 8-page paper. It seems that no code will be released but the method and implementation are quite well described. The reporting of the experimental results is also reasonable for an 8-page paper.

Medical Image Analysis, 70, 102001. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2021.102001 The authors should explain how the function that approximately maps CTA HU to non-contrast CT HU was fitted exactly. Is this type of function usual? The authors should also explain why they predict the difference between CTA and non-contrast CT instead of the non-contrast CT directly. Adding an ablation study assessing the importance of each input would be beneficial. In Fig. 3, the authors could add arrows pointing at the contrast-enhanced vessels or “repetitive patterns” mentioned in the text as they are not all obvious to spot. It would be good to mention what was the element that the radiologist used to recognise fake images. None of the quantitative metrics really allows selecting the best approach while clear differences can be observed visually. This should be discussed. I am not sure that the evaluation based on the ASPECTS score really shows that “no artificial stroke patterns were added and existing signs of stroke were correctly carried over to the NCCT domain”. From what I understood, if in the real image lesions were observed in regions A, B and C, the ASPECT score would be 10 - 3 = 7. Then, if in the fake image lesions were observed in regions D, E and F, the ASPECT score would also be 7. The fact that existing lesions are not detected while non-existing lesions appeared would not be captured. I really appreciate the fact that an application-specific metric is used, but its limitations should clearly be stated.

Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html Introduction In the second to last sentence of the introduction, “…baseline methods…” was mentioned. It would be helpful to mention the baseline method that the results of will be compared to. Methods In the preprocessing section (the second sentence), you can delete the word “percentile” since the ‘%’ symbol is used. Instead of using the title “Proposed Method” for section 2.3, maybe use or use something similar to “SyNCCT Method”. Even though the HU is a unit of measurement, it should still be spelled out before using ‘HU’ Recommended: Also, in the Estimation section, it may be a good idea to skip the “bed of nails” analogy. It doesn’t really add anything to this section. MSE, SSIM, and GAN need to be defined before using the acronym Results In the results section, brain extraction was mentioned, however, this was not mentioned in the ‘Methods’ section. If brain extraction did occur, as mentioned in the ‘Results’ section, then it should be mentioned in the methods section, presumably the preprocessing section. Define ‘Dis’ Please state your overall opinion of the paper strong accept (9) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper?

Main points to improve on, as summarized by the MR, were references for the inverted domain transfer (NCCT to CTA) and clarity of specific aspects of the methodology. Also, we want to comment on some minor points. References: We thank R2 for pointing out interesting work related to this topic. We agree discussing related domain transfer problems increases the quality of the paper. Hence, we extended our related work section in this regard considering space constraints. Methodology: Replying to a question by R2, the parameters of the function (Eq.1, VNC-Est.) were determined using a least-squares fit. Poirot et al. follow a similar idea using a LUT; we adapted this concept to a single-energy problem using Eq. 1. R1 inquired about its influence, which relates to R2’s suggestion on performing an ablation study to assess the benefits of the additional channels. We performed a quasi-ablation study since both baselines are simplifications of the proposed method in the most relevant aspects. Mod. Poirot uses a different architecture and has no additional segmentation channel. CycleGANs do not use Eq. 1 and neither a segmentation nor a residual connection. SyNCCT led to quantitatively and qualitatively superior performance within both (Non/GAN) categories, demonstrating the positive impact of the changes we propose. The ambivalence (mentioned by R2) of the quantitative and qualitative results appears only between GAN and Non-GAN methods. Due to the noisy nature of the images and slight registration inaccuracies, distance-based metrics do not properly represent the perception. Therefore, direct supervision led to smooth results, which is a common problem using MSE. As the GAN methods introduce high frequencies, the MAE becomes substantially different. We added this discussion to the paper. Doubts were expressed by R1 that current automated ASPECTS tools are not sufficiently accurate to be ground truth, which in R1’s opinion impacts the clinical significance of our work. Numerous clinical publications, such as Maegerlein et al. (doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2019181228), Li et al. (doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2019.12.010 ) and Hoefler et al. (doi.org/10.1007/s00234-020-02439-3), have shown that the performance of such tools is comparable to that of a radiologist. The software we used is commercially available and approved for clinical use in the EU. We agree that expert assessments are extremely valuable, which is why we included a Turing test. However, it has to be considered that ASPECTS exhibits a high inter-reader variability, and a reasonable study design for our task would require different readers assessing the real and synthetic NCCTs to avoid bias. This decreases the statistical power of the comparison. Therefore, considering the number of cases available, we preferred to use an automated tool that yields standardized and reproducible results. To address R2’s concern that different sets of affected regions may be responsible for the same final ASPECT score, we added quantitative measures of the coverage between the regions from the SSIM+Dis configuration result with the NCCT regions and found a match of 88% in all regions (SSIM 83%, MSE 83%, MSE+Dis 85%, mod. Poirot 77%, CycleGAN 81%). Thus, the final method does not only perform well on the global ASPECTS score as shown in section 3, but also outperforms the ablations consistently on region-level. Minor points: R1 suggested to publish the FP-rates of the Turing test. Our original submission states the specificity of the experiment and refers to the supplementary material, in which we provide the confusion matrix to accommodate this as well as other requests of that nature. We also followed the suggestions by R3 and R2 (arrows) regarding linguistic improvements to the manuscript. back to top" />

Main points to improve on, as summarized by the MR, were references for the inverted domain transfer (NCCT to CTA) and clarity of specific aspects of the methodology. Also, we want to comment on some minor points. References: We thank R2 for pointing out interesting work related to this topic. We agree discussing related domain transfer problems increases the quality of the paper. Hence, we extended our related work section in this regard considering space constraints. Methodology: Replying to a question by R2, the parameters of the function (Eq.1, VNC-Est.) were determined using a least-squares fit. Poirot et al. follow a similar idea using a LUT; we adapted this concept to a single-energy problem using Eq. 1. R1 inquired about its influence, which relates to R2’s suggestion on performing an ablation study to assess the benefits of the additional channels. We performed a quasi-ablation study since both baselines are simplifications of the proposed method in the most relevant aspects. Mod. Poirot uses a different architecture and has no additional segmentation channel. CycleGANs do not use Eq. 1 and neither a segmentation nor a residual connection. SyNCCT led to quantitatively and qualitatively superior performance within both (Non/GAN) categories, demonstrating the positive impact of the changes we propose. The ambivalence (mentioned by R2) of the quantitative and qualitative results appears only between GAN and Non-GAN methods. Due to the noisy nature of the images and slight registration inaccuracies, distance-based metrics do not properly represent the perception. Therefore, direct supervision led to smooth results, which is a common problem using MSE. As the GAN methods introduce high frequencies, the MAE becomes substantially different. We added this discussion to the paper. Doubts were expressed by R1 that current automated ASPECTS tools are not sufficiently accurate to be ground truth, which in R1’s opinion impacts the clinical significance of our work. Numerous clinical publications, such as Maegerlein et al. (doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2019181228), Li et al. (doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2019.12.010 ) and Hoefler et al. (doi.org/10.1007/s00234-020-02439-3), have shown that the performance of such tools is comparable to that of a radiologist. The software we used is commercially available and approved for clinical use in the EU. We agree that expert assessments are extremely valuable, which is why we included a Turing test. However, it has to be considered that ASPECTS exhibits a high inter-reader variability, and a reasonable study design for our task would require different readers assessing the real and synthetic NCCTs to avoid bias. This decreases the statistical power of the comparison. Therefore, considering the number of cases available, we preferred to use an automated tool that yields standardized and reproducible results. To address R2’s concern that different sets of affected regions may be responsible for the same final ASPECT score, we added quantitative measures of the coverage between the regions from the SSIM+Dis configuration result with the NCCT regions and found a match of 88% in all regions (SSIM 83%, MSE 83%, MSE+Dis 85%, mod. Poirot 77%, CycleGAN 81%). Thus, the final method does not only perform well on the global ASPECTS score as shown in section 3, but also outperforms the ablations consistently on region-level. Minor points: R1 suggested to publish the FP-rates of the Turing test. Our original submission states the specificity of the experiment and refers to the supplementary material, in which we provide the confusion matrix to accommodate this as well as other requests of that nature. We also followed the suggestions by R3 and R2 (arrows) regarding linguistic improvements to the manuscript. back to top" />

This acquisition type is known as CT Angiography (CTA). However, due to typically lower dose levels of CTA scans compared to non-contrast CT acquisitions (NCCT) and the employed reconstruction designed specifically for vessel reconstruction, soft tissue contrast in the brain parenchyma is usually subpar. Hence, an NCCT scan is preferred for the visualization of such tissue. We propose SyNCCT, an approach which synthesizes NCCT images from the CTA domain by removing enhanced vessel structures and improving soft tissue contrast. Contrary to virtual non-contrast (VNC) images based on dual energy scans, which target the physically accurate removal of iodine rather than generating a realistic NCCT with improved gray/white matter separation, our approach only requires a conventional single-energy acquisition. By design, our method integrates prior domain knowledge and employs residual learning as well as a discriminator to achieve perceptual realism. In our data set of patients with ischemic stroke, the absolute differences in automatic ASPECT scoring, which rates early signs of an occlusion in the anterior circulation on a scale from 0 (most severe) to 10 (no signs), was 0.78 +- 0.75 (median of 1) when comparing our SyNCCT to the real NCCT images. Qualitatively, realistic appearance of the images was confirmed by means of a Turing test with a radiologist, who classified 64% of 64 (32 real, 32 generated) images correctly. Two other physicians classified 65% correctly, on average.

Initial results look promising even though the clinical values are still unknown. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The paper is generally of a great shape, and well written. Methodology is straight forward and reasonable. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. validations should be improved. more details on method is needed. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance Cannot reproduce it without code and data. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html It is quite interesting to see a new application of using GAN Fig. 1 is a little confusing. cannot understand the approach only relying on this figure. It is not clear why VNC -EST is needed to train GAN if this estimation only maps CTA HU to CT HUS. DO you think the network cannot learn this nonlinear HU mapping? Turing test showed some positive signals of fake NCCT. but not good enough. It is more interesting to see how many fake NCCT considered as real, or vice verse. using automated ASPECTS software as a tool to evaluate the performance is not convincing . I do not think current ASPECTS software are accurate enough to be ground truth. It is better to ask radiologists to score ASPECTS on both fake and real NCCT. Lack of convincing results limits the clinical relevance of this paper Please state your overall opinion of the paper borderline reject (5) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? Clinical relevance should be strengthen. What is the ranking of this paper in your review stack? 3 Number of papers in your stack 5 Reviewer confidence Very confident Review #2 Please describe the contribution of the paper The authors propose an approach to derive non-contrast CT images from CTA. Three inputs are fed to a 2D Unet: the CTA, the segmentation of the vessels and a first estimate of the synthetic non-contrast CT obtained by applying a function that approximately maps CTA HU to non-contrast CT HU. A discriminator is used to distinguish fake from real non-contrast CTs. The approach is trained/validated on a dataset of 127 patients and tested on 23 patients, all with ischemic strokes. The evaluation consists of a qualitative analysis, an expert validation (Turing test) and a quantitative analysis. In the quantitative analysis, the image synthesis accuracy is evaluated using the generic SSIM and an application-specific score meant to assess infarction severity. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. Novel application: synthesis of non-contrast CT images from CTA Thorough evaluation: qualitative evaluation + expert evaluation using the Turing test + quantitative evaluation using both generic and application-specific metrics Paper clear and easy to follow Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Very sparse coverage of the related works, only one paper is mentioned. Even though the authors target a novel application, several approaches have been developed for contrast-enhanced to non-contrast (and vice-versa) or low-dose to high-dose image synthesis. The individual contributions of the different inputs have not been evaluated. Several methodological points could be better explained, for example how the function that approximately maps CTA HU to non-contrast CT HU was determined, or why predict the difference between CTA and non-contrast CT instead of the non-contrast CT directly. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Very Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The authors have been honest when filling the reproductibilty checklist. The authors use a private dataset that cannot be shared but its description is reasonable for an 8-page paper. It seems that no code will be released but the method and implementation are quite well described. The reporting of the experimental results is also reasonable for an 8-page paper.

Medical Image Analysis, 70, 102001. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2021.102001 The authors should explain how the function that approximately maps CTA HU to non-contrast CT HU was fitted exactly. Is this type of function usual? The authors should also explain why they predict the difference between CTA and non-contrast CT instead of the non-contrast CT directly. Adding an ablation study assessing the importance of each input would be beneficial. In Fig. 3, the authors could add arrows pointing at the contrast-enhanced vessels or “repetitive patterns” mentioned in the text as they are not all obvious to spot. It would be good to mention what was the element that the radiologist used to recognise fake images. None of the quantitative metrics really allows selecting the best approach while clear differences can be observed visually. This should be discussed. I am not sure that the evaluation based on the ASPECTS score really shows that “no artificial stroke patterns were added and existing signs of stroke were correctly carried over to the NCCT domain”. From what I understood, if in the real image lesions were observed in regions A, B and C, the ASPECT score would be 10 - 3 = 7. Then, if in the fake image lesions were observed in regions D, E and F, the ASPECT score would also be 7. The fact that existing lesions are not detected while non-existing lesions appeared would not be captured. I really appreciate the fact that an application-specific metric is used, but its limitations should clearly be stated. Please state your overall opinion of the paper borderline accept (6) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper?

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>By injecting contrast agent during a CT acquisition, the vascular system can be enhanced. This acquisition type is known as CT Angiography (CTA). However, due to typically lower dose levels of CTA scans compared to non-contrast CT acquisitions (NCCT) and the employed reconstruction designed specifically for vessel reconstruction, soft tissue contrast in the brain parenchyma is usually subpar. Hence, an NCCT scan is preferred for the visualization of such tissue. We propose SyNCCT, an approach which synthesizes NCCT images from the CTA domain by removing enhanced vessel structures and improving soft tissue contrast. Contrary to virtual non-contrast (VNC) images based on dual energy scans, which target the physically accurate removal of iodine rather than generating a realistic NCCT with improved gray/white matter separation, our approach only requires a conventional single-energy acquisition. By design, our method integrates prior domain knowledge and employs residual learning as well as a discriminator to achieve perceptual realism. In our data set of patients with ischemic stroke, the absolute differences in automatic ASPECT scoring, which rates early signs of an occlusion in the anterior circulation on a scale from 0 (most severe) to 10 (no signs), was 0.78 +- 0.75 (median of 1) when comparing our SyNCCT to the real NCCT images. Qualitatively, realistic appearance of the images was confirmed by means of a Turing test with a radiologist, who classified 64% of 64 (32 real, 32 generated) images correctly. Two other physicians classified 65% correctly, on average.

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>It is quite interesting to see a new application of using GAN</li>
        <li>Fig. 1 is a little confusing. cannot understand the approach only relying on this figure.</li>
        <li>It is not clear why VNC -EST is needed to train GAN if this estimation only maps CTA HU to CT HUS. DO you think the network cannot learn this nonlinear HU mapping?</li>
        <li>Turing test showed some positive signals of fake NCCT. but not good enough. It is more interesting to see how many fake NCCT considered as real, or vice verse.</li>
        <li>using automated ASPECTS software as a tool to evaluate the performance is not convincing . I do not think current ASPECTS software are accurate enough to be ground truth. It is better to ask radiologists to score ASPECTS on both fake and real NCCT. Lack of convincing results limits the clinical relevance of this paper</li>

<h3 id="review-2">Review #2</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The authors propose an approach to derive non-contrast CT images from CTA. Three inputs are fed to a 2D Unet: the CTA, the segmentation of the vessels and a first estimate of the synthetic non-contrast CT obtained by applying a function that approximately maps CTA HU to non-contrast CT HU. A discriminator is used to distinguish fake from real non-contrast CTs.
The approach is trained/validated on a dataset of 127 patients and tested on 23 patients, all with ischemic strokes. The evaluation consists of a qualitative analysis, an expert validation (Turing test) and a quantitative analysis. In the quantitative analysis, the image synthesis accuracy is evaluated using the generic SSIM and an application-specific score meant to assess infarction severity.</p>
    </blockquote>

Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Novel application: synthesis of non-contrast CT images from CTA</li>
        <li>Thorough evaluation: qualitative evaluation + expert evaluation using the Turing test + quantitative evaluation using both generic and application-specific metrics</li>
        <li>Paper clear and easy to follow</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Very sparse coverage of the related works, only one paper is mentioned. Even though the authors target a novel application, several approaches have been developed for contrast-enhanced to non-contrast (and vice-versa) or low-dose to high-dose image synthesis.</li>
        <li>The individual contributions of the different inputs have not been evaluated.</li>
        <li>Several methodological points could be better explained, for example how the function that approximately maps CTA HU to non-contrast CT HU was determined, or why predict the difference between CTA and non-contrast CT instead of the non-contrast CT directly.</li>
      </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The authors have been honest when filling the reproductibilty checklist. The authors use a private dataset that cannot be shared but its description is reasonable for an 8-page paper. It seems that no code will be released but the method and implementation are quite well described. The reporting of the experimental results is also reasonable for an 8-page paper.</p>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The authors should explain how the function that approximately maps CTA HU to non-contrast CT HU was fitted exactly. Is this type of function usual?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The authors should also explain why they predict the difference between CTA and non-contrast CT instead of the non-contrast CT directly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Adding an ablation study assessing the importance of each input would be beneficial.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In Fig. 3, the authors could add arrows pointing at the contrast-enhanced vessels or “repetitive patterns” mentioned in the text as they are not all obvious to spot.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>It would be good to mention what was the element that the radiologist used to recognise fake images.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>None of the quantitative metrics really allows selecting the best approach while clear differences can be observed visually. This should be discussed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>I am not sure that the evaluation based on the ASPECTS score really shows that “no artificial stroke patterns were added and existing signs of stroke were correctly carried over to the NCCT domain”. From what I understood, if in the real image lesions were observed in regions A, B and C, the ASPECT score would be 10 - 3 = 7. Then, if in the fake image lesions were observed in regions D, E and F, the ASPECT score would also be 7. The fact that existing lesions are not detected while non-existing lesions appeared would not be captured. I really appreciate the fact that an application-specific metric is used, but its limitations should clearly be stated.</li>

      <p>Introduction</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the second to last sentence of the introduction, “…baseline methods…” was mentioned. It would be helpful to mention the baseline method that the results of will be compared to.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Methods</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the preprocessing section (the second sentence), you can delete the word “percentile” since the ‘%’ symbol is used.</li>
        <li>Instead of using the title “Proposed Method” for section 2.3, maybe use or use something similar to “SyNCCT Method”.</li>
        <li>Even though the HU is a unit of measurement, it should still be spelled out before using ‘HU’</li>
        <li>Recommended: Also, in the Estimation section, it may be a good idea to skip the “bed of nails” analogy. It doesn’t really add anything to this section.</li>
        <li>MSE, SSIM, and GAN need to be defined before using the acronym</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Results</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the results section, brain extraction was mentioned, however, this was not mentioned in the ‘Methods’ section. If brain extraction did occur, as mentioned in the ‘Results’ section, then it should be mentioned in the methods section, presumably the preprocessing section.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>We highly appreciate the valuable comments and want to thank all reviewers and the MR for the overall positive assessment and the agreement on novelty, clarity, and thoroughness of evaluation of the proposed work.
Main points to improve on, as summarized by the MR, were references for the inverted domain transfer (NCCT to CTA) and clarity of specific aspects of the methodology. Also, we want to comment on some minor points.
References:
We thank R2 for pointing out interesting work related to this topic. We agree discussing related domain transfer problems increases the quality of the paper. Hence, we extended our related work section in this regard considering space constraints.
Methodology:
Replying to a question by R2, the parameters of the function (Eq.1, VNC-Est.) were determined using a least-squares fit. Poirot et al. follow a similar idea using a LUT; we adapted this concept to a single-energy problem using Eq. 1. R1 inquired about its influence, which relates to R2’s suggestion on performing an ablation study to assess the benefits of the additional channels. We performed a quasi-ablation study since both baselines are simplifications of the proposed method in the most relevant aspects. Mod. Poirot uses a different architecture and has no additional segmentation channel. CycleGANs do not use Eq. 1 and neither a segmentation nor a residual connection. SyNCCT led to quantitatively and qualitatively superior performance within both (Non/GAN) categories, demonstrating the positive impact of the changes we propose.
The ambivalence (mentioned by R2) of the quantitative and qualitative results appears only between GAN and Non-GAN methods. Due to the noisy nature of the images and slight registration inaccuracies, distance-based metrics do not properly represent the perception. Therefore, direct supervision led to smooth results, which is a common problem using MSE. As the GAN methods introduce high frequencies, the MAE becomes substantially different. We added this discussion to the paper.
Doubts were expressed by R1 that current automated ASPECTS tools are not sufficiently accurate to be ground truth, which in R1’s opinion impacts the clinical significance of our work. Numerous clinical publications, such as Maegerlein et al. (doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2019181228), Li et al. (doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2019.12.010 ) and Hoefler et al. (doi.org/10.1007/s00234-020-02439-3), have shown that the performance of such tools is comparable to that of a radiologist. The software we used is commercially available and approved for clinical use in the EU. We agree that expert assessments are extremely valuable, which is why we included a Turing test. However, it has to be considered that ASPECTS exhibits a high inter-reader variability, and a reasonable study design for our task would require different readers assessing the real and synthetic NCCTs to avoid bias. This decreases the statistical power of the comparison. Therefore, considering the number of cases available, we preferred to use an automated tool that yields standardized and reproducible results.
To address R2’s concern that different sets of affected regions may be responsible for the same final ASPECT score, we added quantitative measures of the coverage between the regions from the SSIM+Dis configuration result with the NCCT regions and found a match of 88% in all regions (SSIM 83%, MSE 83%, MSE+Dis 85%, mod. Poirot 77%, CycleGAN 81%). Thus, the final method does not only perform well on the global ASPECTS score as shown in section 3, but also outperforms the ablations consistently on region-level.
Minor points:
R1 suggested to publish the FP-rates of the Turing test. Our original submission states the specificity of the experiment and refers to the supplementary material, in which we provide the confusion matrix to accommodate this as well as other requests of that nature. We also followed the suggestions by R3 and R2 (arrows) regarding linguistic improvements to the manuscript.</p>
