<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Yongsheng Pan, Yuanyuan Chen, Dinggang Shen, Yong Xia Abstract The missing data issue is a common problem in multi-modal neuroimage (e.g., MRI and PET) based diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. Although various generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been developed to impute the missing data, most current solutions treat the image imputation and disease diagnosis as two standalone tasks without considering the impact of diagnosis on image synthesis, leading to less competent synthetic images to the diagnosis task. In this paper, we propose the collaborative diagnosis-synthesis framework (CDSF) for joint missing neuroimage imputation and multi-modal diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. Under the CDSF framework, there are an image synthesis module (ISM) and a multi-modal diagnosis module (MDM), which were trained in a collaborative manner. Specifically, ISM is trained under the supervision of MDM, which poses the feature-consistent constraint to the cross-modality image synthesis, while MDM learns the disease-related multi-modal information from both real and synthetic multi-modal neuroimages. We evaluated our CDSF model against five image synthesis methods and three multi-modal diagnosis models on an ADNI datasets with 1464 subjects. Our results suggest that the proposed CDSF model not only generates neuroimages with higher quality, but also achieves the state-of-the-art performance in AD identification and MCI-to-AD conversion prediction.

Here are responses to some specific comments and the corresponding changes will be applied to the camera-ready version. Q1: Not the best in MRI synthesis. (R2) A1: Since PET is the major missing modality, synthesizing PET modality is relatively more important. Meanwhile, while testing our algorithm, only real MRI scans are used since all subjects have real MRI scans. In our further work, we will also take some measures to enhance the quality of synthetic MRI. Q2: Technical novelty. (R3) A2: The major novelty of paper is the collaborative diagnosis-synthesis framework (CDSF) for joint missing neuroimage imputation and multi-modal diagnosis. It is the first to create a two-way information flow, which forwards both the synthesis model and diagnosis model to the same diagnosis goal. For a fair comparison, we use a similar network structure to previous work. The overall performance benefits mainly from the collaborative strategy. Q3: Performance of image synthesis. (R3) A3: It should be noticed that our goal is to do diagnosis on incomplete multimodal images, and hence image synthesis is not our final task. Since we do not take specific techniques to enhance the visual quality, it is foreseeable that our synthesis does not lead to obviously improved visual quality (e.g., MSE). Q4: Overfitting and the data leakage. (R3) A4: It should be also noticed that synthetic images are also used to train the diagnosis model, leading to hugely increased data variety. Meanwhile, the subjects appeared in both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 are removed from ADNI-2. Thus, these is no overlap between the training and test sets. Q5: Minor clarifications (R4) A5: We have thoroughly checked our manuscript, and the corrections to these mistakes and typos will be applied to the camera-ready version. back to top" />

For example, the author should point out what the RNB in Fig. 2 stands for. Also, how does the authors prevent the problem over-fitting due to small data sets? What is the ranking of this paper in your stack? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 2 Author Feedback We sincerely thank all reviewers and ACs for their insightful and invaluable comments and suggestions. Here are responses to some specific comments and the corresponding changes will be applied to the camera-ready version. Q1: Not the best in MRI synthesis. (R2) A1: Since PET is the major missing modality, synthesizing PET modality is relatively more important. Meanwhile, while testing our algorithm, only real MRI scans are used since all subjects have real MRI scans. In our further work, we will also take some measures to enhance the quality of synthetic MRI. Q2: Technical novelty. (R3) A2: The major novelty of paper is the collaborative diagnosis-synthesis framework (CDSF) for joint missing neuroimage imputation and multi-modal diagnosis. It is the first to create a two-way information flow, which forwards both the synthesis model and diagnosis model to the same diagnosis goal. For a fair comparison, we use a similar network structure to previous work. The overall performance benefits mainly from the collaborative strategy. Q3: Performance of image synthesis. (R3) A3: It should be noticed that our goal is to do diagnosis on incomplete multimodal images, and hence image synthesis is not our final task. Since we do not take specific techniques to enhance the visual quality, it is foreseeable that our synthesis does not lead to obviously improved visual quality (e.g., MSE). Q4: Overfitting and the data leakage. (R3) A4: It should be also noticed that synthetic images are also used to train the diagnosis model, leading to hugely increased data variety. Meanwhile, the subjects appeared in both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 are removed from ADNI-2. Thus, these is no overlap between the training and test sets. Q5: Minor clarifications (R4) A5: We have thoroughly checked our manuscript, and the corrections to these mistakes and typos will be applied to the camera-ready version. back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>The missing data issue is a common problem in multi-modal neuroimage (e.g., MRI and PET) based diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. Although various generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been developed to impute the missing data, most current solutions treat the image imputation and disease diagnosis as two standalone tasks without considering the impact of diagnosis on image synthesis, leading to less competent synthetic images to the diagnosis task.
In this paper, we propose the collaborative diagnosis-synthesis framework (CDSF) for joint missing neuroimage imputation and multi-modal diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. Under the CDSF framework, there are an image synthesis module (ISM) and a multi-modal diagnosis module (MDM), which were trained in a collaborative manner. Specifically, ISM is trained under the supervision of MDM, which poses the feature-consistent constraint to the cross-modality image synthesis, while MDM learns the disease-related multi-modal information from both real and synthetic multi-modal neuroimages.  We evaluated our CDSF model against five image synthesis methods and three multi-modal diagnosis models on an ADNI datasets with 1464 subjects. Our results suggest that the proposed CDSF model not only generates neuroimages with higher quality, but also achieves the state-of-the-art performance in AD identification and MCI-to-AD conversion prediction.

      <p>The paper describes a framework to train a model that works with missing data in a multi-modal classification problem. Previous approaches typically impute or generate missing data independently of the final classification task but the proposed method combines data imputation and the final classification task.

  <p>We sincerely thank all reviewers and ACs for their insightful and invaluable comments and suggestions. Here are responses to some specific comments and the corresponding changes will be applied to the camera-ready version.</p>

  <p>Q1: Not the best in MRI synthesis. (R2)
A1: Since PET is the major missing modality, synthesizing PET modality is relatively more important. Meanwhile, while testing our algorithm, only real MRI scans are used since all subjects have real MRI scans. In our further work, we will also take some measures to enhance the quality of synthetic MRI.</p>
