<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Zeyu Gao, Jiangbo Shi, Xianli Zhang, Yang Li, Haichuan Zhang, Jialun Wu, Chunbao Wang, Deyu Meng, Chen Li Abstract The grade of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a critical prognostic factor, making ccRCC nuclei grading a crucial task in RCC pathology analysis. Computer-aided nuclei grading aims to improve pathologists’ work efficiency while reducing their misdiagnosis rate by automatically identifying the grades of tumor nuclei within histopathological images. Such a task requires precisely segment and accurately classify the nuclei. However, most of the existing nuclei segmentation and classification methods can not handle the inter-class similarity property of nuclei grading, thus can not be directly applied to the ccRCC grading task. In this paper, we propose a Composite High-Resolution Network for ccRCC nuclei grading. Specifically, we propose a segmentation network called W-Net that can separate the clustered nuclei. Then, we recast the fine-grained classification of nuclei to two cross-category classification tasks, based on two high-resolution feature extractors (HRFEs) which are proposed for learning these two tasks. The two HRFEs share the same backbone encoder with W-Net by a composite connection so that meaningful features for the segmentation task can be inherited for the classification task. Last, a head-fusion block is applied to generate the predicted label of each nucleus. Furthermore, we introduce a dataset for ccRCC nuclei grading, containing 1000 image patches with 70945 annotated nuclei. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods on this large ccRCC grading dataset.

An integrated segmentation and classification network is designed. The method is evaluated on a private dataset and shows improved performance over other well-known methods. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. Method description is quite clear. Overall network architecture is new. Evaluation shows improved performance over U-Net, Mask R-CNN, etc. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.

Also, a corresponding dataset of ccRCCC with 70945 fine-graded labels (grades 1, 2 and 3 and endothelial nuclei) is contributed. Data and code are available which is important for reproducibility. Proposed method outperformed four competitors. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The main strength of this paper is a two-stage learning framework W-Net to generate nuclei distance map from the image patch. In the first stage U-Net generates binary map. In the second stage a lightweight U-Net is used to extract the shape and distance-related features from the generated binary maps, yielding the distance map. Another main strength is two cross-category classification system for generating aggregated probability map. The crucial part of this system is high resolution feature extractor (HRFE) comprised of parallel high-to-low resolution convolution network with three multi-resolution streams. It is shown in the ablation study that multi-resolution streams in combination with the two-stage segmentation network is crucial for obtaining good segmentation and classification results. Also, a corresponding dataset of ccRCCC with 70945 fine-graded labels (grades 1, 2 and 3 and endothelial nuclei) is contributed. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Instead of U-Net it would be more beneficial to use the DeepLabv3 network.

Reviewer 1： Question 4: Dataset is private, and hence there can only be very limited follow-up study on similar problem domains. Due to the blind review mechanism of the conference, our dataset and code are not open0source yet. However, it will be made public and a download link will be provided soon. The method involves some post-processing steps. It’s not clear how important these steps are. What if similar post-processing is applied to U-Net or Mask R-CNN? Will they obtain better results? The ablation experiments in this paper verify the effect of post-processing on the segmentation performance of the model. As shown in Table 2, after the UDist and WDist operations are introduced on MHR, the performance of the model has been improved to varying degrees. There are other more advanced instance or panoptic segmentation methods designed specifically for nucleus segmentation. It would be good to see a direct comparison with those methods. As far as we know, prior to this work, Hover-Net was a representative work to solve the problem of panoptic nuclei segmentation, and it obtained the experimental results of state of the art. At the same time, we also compared classic segmentation algorithms such as U-net and Mask-RCNN in the comparative experiment in Table 1 to prove the superiority of the proposed method. Reviewer 2: Question 7: -HRFE net predicting nuclei class by taking the auxiliary feature maps as input. However, I cannot find details of how this auxiliary feature map is generated. From Fig.2., it can be seen intuitively that the input of the HRFE module is generated after the two original images of 100x and 400x are extracted by a res-block. -It is desired to show some examples of nuclei of different grades to help understand the task. The author mentioned: “However, the grade 2 tumor nuclei are almost same as grade 1 at 100x magnification, as grade 3 at 400x magnification.” It is desired to show examples in 100x and 400x for comparison. Due to space limitations, we did not include example images of different resolutions (100x and 400x) and grading result images in the paper, which are covered in the supplementary materials. back to top" />

Also, a corresponding dataset of ccRCCC with 70945 fine-graded labels (grades 1, 2 and 3 and endothelial nuclei) is contributed. Data and code are available which is important for reproducibility. Proposed method outperformed four competitors. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The main strength of this paper is a two-stage learning framework W-Net to generate nuclei distance map from the image patch. In the first stage U-Net generates binary map. In the second stage a lightweight U-Net is used to extract the shape and distance-related features from the generated binary maps, yielding the distance map. Another main strength is two cross-category classification system for generating aggregated probability map. The crucial part of this system is high resolution feature extractor (HRFE) comprised of parallel high-to-low resolution convolution network with three multi-resolution streams. It is shown in the ablation study that multi-resolution streams in combination with the two-stage segmentation network is crucial for obtaining good segmentation and classification results. Also, a corresponding dataset of ccRCCC with 70945 fine-graded labels (grades 1, 2 and 3 and endothelial nuclei) is contributed. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Instead of U-Net it would be more beneficial to use the DeepLabv3 network. Through the mechanism known as a-trous convolution this network preserves high-resolution feature map.

Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 1 Author Feedback Thank you for your time and constructive comments, and we glad to have this opportunity to discuss our work. Reviewer 1： Question 4: Dataset is private, and hence there can only be very limited follow-up study on similar problem domains. Due to the blind review mechanism of the conference, our dataset and code are not open0source yet. However, it will be made public and a download link will be provided soon. The method involves some post-processing steps. It’s not clear how important these steps are. What if similar post-processing is applied to U-Net or Mask R-CNN? Will they obtain better results? The ablation experiments in this paper verify the effect of post-processing on the segmentation performance of the model. As shown in Table 2, after the UDist and WDist operations are introduced on MHR, the performance of the model has been improved to varying degrees. There are other more advanced instance or panoptic segmentation methods designed specifically for nucleus segmentation. It would be good to see a direct comparison with those methods. As far as we know, prior to this work, Hover-Net was a representative work to solve the problem of panoptic nuclei segmentation, and it obtained the experimental results of state of the art. At the same time, we also compared classic segmentation algorithms such as U-net and Mask-RCNN in the comparative experiment in Table 1 to prove the superiority of the proposed method. Reviewer 2: Question 7: -HRFE net predicting nuclei class by taking the auxiliary feature maps as input. However, I cannot find details of how this auxiliary feature map is generated. From Fig.2., it can be seen intuitively that the input of the HRFE module is generated after the two original images of 100x and 400x are extracted by a res-block. -It is desired to show some examples of nuclei of different grades to help understand the task. The author mentioned: “However, the grade 2 tumor nuclei are almost same as grade 1 at 100x magnification, as grade 3 at 400x magnification.” It is desired to show examples in 100x and 400x for comparison. Due to space limitations, we did not include example images of different resolutions (100x and 400x) and grading result images in the paper, which are covered in the supplementary materials. back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>The grade of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a critical prognostic factor, making ccRCC nuclei grading a crucial task in RCC pathology analysis. Computer-aided nuclei grading aims to improve pathologists’ work efficiency while reducing their misdiagnosis rate by automatically identifying the grades of tumor nuclei within histopathological images. Such a task requires precisely segment and accurately classify the nuclei. However, most of the existing nuclei segmentation and classification methods can not handle the inter-class similarity property of nuclei grading, thus can not be directly applied to the ccRCC grading task. In this paper, we propose a Composite High-Resolution Network for ccRCC nuclei grading. Specifically, we propose a segmentation network called W-Net that can separate the clustered nuclei. Then, we recast the fine-grained classification of nuclei to two cross-category classification tasks, based on two high-resolution feature extractors (HRFEs) which are proposed for learning these two tasks. The two HRFEs share the same backbone encoder with W-Net by a composite connection so that meaningful features for the segmentation task can be inherited for the classification task. Last, a head-fusion block is applied to generate the predicted label of each nucleus. Furthermore, we introduce a dataset for ccRCC nuclei grading, containing 1000 image patches with 70945 annotated nuclei. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods on this large ccRCC grading dataset.

    <blockquote>
      <p>This paper proposes a novel nuclei segmentation and classification method aimed for nuclei grading of clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC). Also, a corresponding dataset of ccRCCC with 70945 fine-graded labels (grades 1, 2 and 3 and endothelial nuclei) is contributed. Data and code are available which is important for reproducibility. Proposed method outperformed four competitors.</p>

  <li><strong>Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The main strength of this paper is a two-stage learning framework W-Net to generate nuclei distance map from the image patch.  In the first stage U-Net generates binary map. In the second stage a lightweight U-Net is used to extract the shape and distance-related features from the generated binary maps, yielding the distance map. Another main strength is two cross-category classification system for generating aggregated probability map. The crucial part of this system is high resolution feature extractor (HRFE) comprised of parallel high-to-low resolution convolution network with three multi-resolution streams. It is shown in the ablation study that multi-resolution streams in combination with the two-stage segmentation network is crucial for obtaining good segmentation and classification results. Also, a corresponding dataset of ccRCCC with 70945 fine-graded labels (grades 1, 2 and 3 and endothelial nuclei) is contributed.</p>

  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Instead of U-Net it would be more beneficial to use the DeepLabv3 network. Through the mechanism known as a-trous convolution this network preserves high-resolution feature map.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your time and constructive comments, and we glad to have this opportunity to discuss our work.</p>

  <p>Reviewer 1：
Question 4:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Dataset is private, and hence there can only be very limited follow-up study on similar problem domains.
Due to the blind review mechanism of the conference, our dataset and code are not open0source yet. However, it will be made public and a download link will be provided soon.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The method involves some post-processing steps. It’s not clear how important these steps are. What if similar post-processing is applied to U-Net or Mask R-CNN? Will they obtain better results?
The ablation experiments in this paper verify the effect of post-processing on the segmentation performance of the model. As shown in Table 2, after the UDist and WDist operations are introduced on MHR, the performance of the model has been improved to varying degrees.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>There are other more advanced instance or panoptic segmentation methods designed specifically for nucleus segmentation. It would be good to see a direct comparison with those methods.
As far as we know, prior to this work, Hover-Net was a representative work to solve the problem of panoptic nuclei segmentation, and it obtained the experimental results of state of the art. At the same time, we also compared classic segmentation algorithms such as U-net and Mask-RCNN in the comparative experiment in Table 1 to prove the superiority of the proposed method.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Reviewer 2:
Question 7:
-HRFE net predicting nuclei class by taking the auxiliary feature maps as input. However, I cannot find details of how this auxiliary feature map is generated. 
From Fig.2., it can be seen intuitively that the input of the HRFE module is generated after the two original images of 100x and 400x are extracted by a res-block.</p>

  <p>-It is desired to show some examples of nuclei of different grades to help understand the task. The author mentioned: “However, the grade 2 tumor nuclei are almost same as grade 1 at 100x magnification, as grade 3 at 400x magnification.” It is desired to show examples in 100x and 400x for comparison.
Due to space limitations, we did not include example images of different resolutions (100x and 400x) and grading result images in the paper, which are covered in the supplementary materials.</p>
