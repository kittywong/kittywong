Prince, Georges El Fakhri, Jonghye Woo Abstract Self-training based unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has shown great potential to address the problem of domain shift, when applying a trained deep learning model in a source domain to unlabeled target domains. However, while the self-training UDA has demonstrated its effectiveness on discriminative tasks, such as classification and segmentation, via the reliable pseudo-label selection based on the softmax discrete histogram, the self-training UDA for generative tasks, such as image synthesis, is not fully investigated. In this work, we propose a novel generative self-training (GST) UDA framework with continuous value prediction and regression objective for cross-domain image synthesis. Specifically, we propose to filter the pseudo-label with an uncertainty mask, and quantify the predictive confidence of generated images with practical variational Bayes learning. The fast test-time adaptation is achieved by a round-based alternative optimization scheme. We validated our framework on the tagged-to-cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) synthesis problem, where datasets in the source and target domains were acquired from different scanners or centers. Extensive validations were carried out to verify our framework against popular adversarial training UDA methods. Results show that our GST, with tagged MRI of test subjects in new target domains, improved the synthesis quality by a large margin, compared with the adversarial training UDA methods.

Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The method proposed by this paper is novel and interesting, it proposesto fi lter the pseudo-label with an uncertainty mask, and quantify the predictive confi dence of generated images with practical variational Bayes learning. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Though it compares with two mainstream adversarial training based UDA methods, there are other sota UDA methods in the literature, it would be great to include a few more.

This paper presents a novel self-training based unsupervised domain adaptation framework for image generation with continuous value prediction and regression objectives used for image synthesis. Pseudo labels used for self training are combined with a uncertainty mask, which is learned from a Bayesian neural network. The uncertainty mask determines which psuedo-labels are used for training, and the overall objective function is then optimized following a two-step alternative training approach for each iteration. A curriculum-learning scheme is also applied by adjusting the confidence threshold for uncertainty so that increasing psuedo-label samples are used for training in an easy to hard scheme.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Self-training based unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has shown great potential to address the problem of domain shift, when applying a trained deep learning model in a source domain to unlabeled target domains. However, while the self-training UDA has demonstrated its effectiveness on discriminative tasks, such as classification and segmentation, via the reliable pseudo-label selection based on the softmax discrete histogram, the self-training UDA for generative tasks, such as image synthesis, is not fully investigated. In this work, we propose a novel generative self-training (GST) UDA framework with continuous value prediction and regression objective for cross-domain image synthesis. Specifically, we propose to filter the pseudo-label with an uncertainty mask, and quantify the predictive confidence of generated images with practical variational Bayes learning. The fast test-time adaptation is achieved by a round-based alternative optimization scheme. We validated our framework on the tagged-to-cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) synthesis problem, where datasets in the source and target domains were acquired from different scanners or centers. Extensive validations were carried out to verify our framework against popular adversarial training UDA methods. Results show that our GST, with tagged MRI of test subjects in new target domains, improved the synthesis quality by a large margin, compared with the adversarial training UDA methods.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Self-training based unsupervised domain adaptation has been applied to discriminative tasks such as classification and segmentation in recent works, but have not been explored for generative tasks. This paper presents a novel self-training based unsupervised domain adaptation framework for image generation with continuous value prediction and regression objectives used for image synthesis. Pseudo labels used for self training are combined with a uncertainty mask, which is learned from a Bayesian neural network. The uncertainty mask determines which psuedo-labels are used for training, and the overall objective function is then optimized following a two-step alternative training approach for each iteration. A curriculum-learning scheme is also applied by adjusting the confidence threshold for uncertainty so that increasing psuedo-label samples are used for training in an easy to hard scheme.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>1, the paper is well written and easy to understand. 
2, the motivation is clear. Although there are a lot of works on using uncertainty to modify the presdo labels, the authors argued that they are the first to modify it for regression problem.</p>
    </blockquote>

  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1, In Eq 1, \hat{y_t,n} is the generated target prediction. During the training, the target labels are not available. What is the other y_t,n? How to get it? 
It is not clear the relationship between two {y_t,n} in Eq 1.</p>

      <p>2, The two uncertainty is not novel. The novelty is in Eq. 1. But actually, I cannot understand how to get two {y_t,n} from the network?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The paper proposes a self-training approach for cross-domain tagged-to-cine MRI synthesis. The main novelty of this work is in extending the self-training UDA framework from classification to regression tasks with the help of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty measures. Empirical results demonstrate improved synthesis quality for cross-scanner and cross-center synthesis tasks.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>(1) Extending self-training-based UDA approaches with epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty measures is novel.

      <p>This paper introduces an interesting method for tagged-to-cine MRI image synthesis by extending self-training-based unsupervised domain adaptation for generative tasks. While reviewers gave consistently positive comments (clear/borderline accept), they raised several questions and provided some suggestions to improve the clarity of the paper, e.g., describe the design of Eq. (1) in detail, explain the usage of evaluation metrics in different experiments, and clarify if the experiments demonstrate the necessity of the easy-to-hard curriculum. Please consider these suggestions when preparing the final manuscript.</p>
