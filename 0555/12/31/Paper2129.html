Image anomaly detection methods that learn normal appearance from only healthy data have shown promising results recently. We propose an alternative to image reconstruction-based and image embedding-based methods and propose a new self-supervised method to tackle pathological anomaly detection. Our approach originates in the foreign patch interpolation (FPI) strategy that has shown superior performance on brain MRI and abdominal CT data. We propose to use a better patch interpolation strategy, Poisson image interpolation (PII), which makes our method suitable for applications in challenging data regimes. PII outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a good margin when tested on surrogate tasks like identifying common lung anomalies in chest X-rays or hypo-plastic left heart syndrome in prenatal, fetal cardiac ultrasound images.

Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html The context of the paper is well introduced. It tackles a topic of high interest in the MICCAI community. The related work section is well organized, it follows the same structure as the paper by Tan et al. The method is clearly presented, both the Poisson image editing, as well as the general framework for anomaly detection. Figure 1 provides a clear illustration of the limits of the FPI method and the contribution of the paper. It could be useful to indicate what values of alpha were chosen for the two illustrative cases (subtle and dramatic). Regarding the experimental setup, two datasets were considered one of which is public (Chest Xray) with a relatively large number of images. The evaluation metric is well defined and appropriate. The quantitative results show the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the art anomaly detection methods. However, the qualitative results could benefit from more description. In the examples illustrated in Figure 3, we see that the PII method seems to correctly detect image-level abnormalities in the case of Mass and HLHS. However, it is of great interest to know if the image areas with a higher score (PII) actually correspond to physiological abnormalities. In other words, at a pixel level, how does the detection performs in localizing the abnormality (especially for the HLHS result) . Just a few words in the results section would be enough. Also, the paragraph above Fig. 3 is a bit unclear. Why and how is FPI sensitive to sharp edges (it does not seems so in Fig 3) ? A few typos to correct: page 2 in Contribution: “usefulNess” page 4 last paragraph: replace 4 by “four” Please state your overall opinion of the paper Probably accept (7) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? The paper is well organized, it is clear. The experimental setup is rigorous. The problem tackle is, I beleive of high interest to the community. The novelty is mostly incremental, with reference to the paper of Tan et al. on Foreign Patch Interpolation.

Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 2 Author Feedback We thank the reviewers for their positive comments and constructive feedback! One of the main concerns is the novelty of PII (ours) compared to FPI and CutPaste. The biggest difference between PII and FPI is the way that patches are combined. FPI uses a convex combination of two patches, whereas PII uses Poisson blending. Because patches come from different images, a simple convex combination can lead to obvious artifacts/discontinuities to which the model can easily overfit. Poisson blending automatically matches intensity levels of different patches and blends them seamlessly. This creates more subtle irregularities during training and it helps the model to better detect real abnormalities, even in challenging cases where data is less uniform (e.g. chest X-ray and fetal ultrasound). Most self-supervised tasks use geometric transformations (Golan and El-Yaniv, 2018); image filtering, Sobel edge detection or blurring (Tack et al., 2020); simple linear combinations of pixels, e.g. MixUp (Zhang et al., 2018); patch extraction, e.g. CutOut (DeVries and Taylor, 2017); or patch re-arrangement, e.g. Jigsaw (Noroozi and Favaro, 2017). We believe PII is one of the first self-supervised methods that solves partial differential equations on the fly to generate training samples dynamically. To achieve this, we use multiprocessing to generate samples in parallel. Our Poisson blending method is adapted from Poisson Image Editing (Perez et al. 2003). The original Poisson Image Editing method takes the image gradient from both patches and discards the weaker gradient. But in PII, image gradients are scaled by an interpolation factor, which allows us to control which image gradients take precedence. This creates more variety in training samples, i.e. more ways in which two patches can be combined. It also helps create a self-supervised task with varying degrees of difficulty, ranging from very subtle to more prominent structural differences. Regarding CutPaste, as far as we know, it was uploaded to arXiv on April 8, 2021, about one month after the MICCAI submission deadline. There are several major differences. CutPaste takes a patch from one image and moves it to a new location in the same image, whereas PII combines patches from different images, creating more variety of combinations, which are more specific to medical imaging problems. CutPaste is a binary classification task at the image or patch level, whereas PII regresses different degrees of abnormality and directly predicts pixel-wise abnormality scores. As seen in the CutPaste experiments (Li et al., 2021), their method is suitable for detecting manufacturing defects such as cracks or scratches. However, many medical abnormalities, such as pneumonia, do not have sharp discontinuities. Meanwhile, congenital heart defects occur organically (during heart formation) which leads to cardiac structures that are very natural looking, albeit pathological. This is unlike breakages seen in manufacturing defects. PII is able to tackle these challenging cases by creating irregularities that are blended naturally into the surrounding context. We will modify the submission to clarify these points. The reviewers also make great suggestions for additional experiments and comparisons. Due to limited space in the current submission, we plan to follow these suggestions in future work. back to top" />

They give quite enough details on the architecture used as well as the optimization parameters, the training time, and so on. It is also mentionned in the paper that the code will be made available by the time of the conference. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html The context of the paper is well introduced. It tackles a topic of high interest in the MICCAI community. The related work section is well organized, it follows the same structure as the paper by Tan et al. The method is clearly presented, both the Poisson image editing, as well as the general framework for anomaly detection. Figure 1 provides a clear illustration of the limits of the FPI method and the contribution of the paper. It could be useful to indicate what values of alpha were chosen for the two illustrative cases (subtle and dramatic). Regarding the experimental setup, two datasets were considered one of which is public (Chest Xray) with a relatively large number of images. The evaluation metric is well defined and appropriate. The quantitative results show the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the art anomaly detection methods. However, the qualitative results could benefit from more description. In the examples illustrated in Figure 3, we see that the PII method seems to correctly detect image-level abnormalities in the case of Mass and HLHS. However, it is of great interest to know if the image areas with a higher score (PII) actually correspond to physiological abnormalities. In other words, at a pixel level, how does the detection performs in localizing the abnormality (especially for the HLHS result) . Just a few words in the results section would be enough. Also, the paragraph above Fig. 3 is a bit unclear. Why and how is FPI sensitive to sharp edges (it does not seems so in Fig 3) ? A few typos to correct: page 2 in Contribution: “usefulNess” page 4 last paragraph: replace 4 by “four” Please state your overall opinion of the paper Probably accept (7) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? The paper is well organized, it is clear. The experimental setup is rigorous. The problem tackle is, I beleive of high interest to the community. The novelty is mostly incremental, with reference to the paper of Tan et al. on Foreign Patch Interpolation.

Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 2 Author Feedback We thank the reviewers for their positive comments and constructive feedback! One of the main concerns is the novelty of PII (ours) compared to FPI and CutPaste. The biggest difference between PII and FPI is the way that patches are combined. FPI uses a convex combination of two patches, whereas PII uses Poisson blending. Because patches come from different images, a simple convex combination can lead to obvious artifacts/discontinuities to which the model can easily overfit. Poisson blending automatically matches intensity levels of different patches and blends them seamlessly. This creates more subtle irregularities during training and it helps the model to better detect real abnormalities, even in challenging cases where data is less uniform (e.g. chest X-ray and fetal ultrasound). Most self-supervised tasks use geometric transformations (Golan and El-Yaniv, 2018); image filtering, Sobel edge detection or blurring (Tack et al., 2020); simple linear combinations of pixels, e.g. MixUp (Zhang et al., 2018); patch extraction, e.g. CutOut (DeVries and Taylor, 2017); or patch re-arrangement, e.g. Jigsaw (Noroozi and Favaro, 2017). We believe PII is one of the first self-supervised methods that solves partial differential equations on the fly to generate training samples dynamically. To achieve this, we use multiprocessing to generate samples in parallel. Our Poisson blending method is adapted from Poisson Image Editing (Perez et al. 2003). The original Poisson Image Editing method takes the image gradient from both patches and discards the weaker gradient. But in PII, image gradients are scaled by an interpolation factor, which allows us to control which image gradients take precedence. This creates more variety in training samples, i.e. more ways in which two patches can be combined. It also helps create a self-supervised task with varying degrees of difficulty, ranging from very subtle to more prominent structural differences. Regarding CutPaste, as far as we know, it was uploaded to arXiv on April 8, 2021, about one month after the MICCAI submission deadline. There are several major differences. CutPaste takes a patch from one image and moves it to a new location in the same image, whereas PII combines patches from different images, creating more variety of combinations, which are more specific to medical imaging problems. CutPaste is a binary classification task at the image or patch level, whereas PII regresses different degrees of abnormality and directly predicts pixel-wise abnormality scores. As seen in the CutPaste experiments (Li et al., 2021), their method is suitable for detecting manufacturing defects such as cracks or scratches. However, many medical abnormalities, such as pneumonia, do not have sharp discontinuities. Meanwhile, congenital heart defects occur organically (during heart formation) which leads to cardiac structures that are very natural looking, albeit pathological. This is unlike breakages seen in manufacturing defects. PII is able to tackle these challenging cases by creating irregularities that are blended naturally into the surrounding context. We will modify the submission to clarify these points. The reviewers also make great suggestions for additional experiments and comparisons. Due to limited space in the current submission, we plan to follow these suggestions in future work. back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Supervised learning of every possible pathology is unrealistic for many primary care applications like health screening. Image anomaly detection methods that learn normal appearance from only healthy data have shown promising results recently. We propose an alternative to image reconstruction-based and image embedding-based methods and propose a new self-supervised method to tackle pathological anomaly detection. Our approach originates in the foreign patch interpolation (FPI) strategy that has shown superior  performance on brain MRI and abdominal CT data. We propose to use a better patch interpolation strategy, Poisson image interpolation (PII), which makes our method suitable for applications in challenging data regimes. PII outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a good margin when tested on surrogate tasks like identifying common lung anomalies in chest X-rays or hypo-plastic left heart syndrome in prenatal, fetal cardiac ultrasound images. Code available at https://github.com/jemtan/PII.

    <blockquote>
      <p>The context of the paper is well introduced. It tackles a topic of high interest in the MICCAI community. The related work section is well organized, it follows the same structure as the paper by Tan et al.</p>

      <p>The method is clearly presented, both the Poisson image editing, as well as the general framework for anomaly detection. Figure 1 provides a clear illustration of the limits of the FPI method and the contribution of the paper. It could be useful to indicate what values of alpha were chosen for the two illustrative cases (subtle and dramatic).</p>

      <p>Regarding the experimental setup, two datasets were considered one of which is public (Chest Xray) with a relatively large number of images. The evaluation metric is well defined and appropriate.</p>

      <p>The quantitative results show the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the art anomaly detection methods. However, the qualitative results could benefit from more description. In the examples illustrated in Figure 3, we see that the PII method seems to correctly detect image-level abnormalities in the case of Mass and HLHS. However, it is of great interest to know if the image areas with a higher score (PII) actually correspond to physiological abnormalities. In other words, at a pixel level, how does the detection performs in localizing the abnormality (especially for the HLHS result) . Just a few words in the results section would be enough. Also, the paragraph above Fig. 3 is a bit unclear. Why and how is FPI  sensitive to sharp edges (it does not seems so in Fig 3) ?</p>

      <p>A few typos to correct:</p>

        <li>page 4 last paragraph: replace 4 by “four”</li>

  <p>We thank the reviewers for their positive comments and constructive feedback!</p>

  <p>One of the main concerns is the novelty of PII (ours) compared to FPI and CutPaste. The biggest difference between PII and FPI is the way that patches are combined. FPI uses a convex combination of two patches, whereas PII uses Poisson blending. Because patches come from different images, a simple convex combination can lead to obvious artifacts/discontinuities to which the model can easily overfit. Poisson blending automatically matches intensity levels of different patches and blends them seamlessly. This creates more subtle irregularities during training and it helps the model to better detect real abnormalities, even in challenging cases where data is less uniform (e.g. chest X-ray and fetal ultrasound).</p>

  <p>Most self-supervised tasks use geometric transformations (Golan and El-Yaniv, 2018); image filtering, Sobel edge detection or blurring (Tack et al., 2020); simple linear combinations of pixels, e.g. MixUp (Zhang et al., 2018); patch extraction, e.g. CutOut (DeVries and Taylor, 2017); or patch re-arrangement, e.g. Jigsaw (Noroozi and Favaro, 2017). We believe PII is one of the first self-supervised methods that solves partial differential equations on the fly to generate training samples dynamically. To achieve this, we use multiprocessing to generate samples in parallel. Our Poisson blending method is adapted from Poisson Image Editing (Perez et al. 2003). The original Poisson Image Editing method takes the image gradient from both patches and discards the weaker gradient. But in PII, image gradients are scaled by an interpolation factor, which allows us to control which image gradients take precedence. This creates more variety in training samples, i.e. more ways in which two patches can be combined. It also helps create a self-supervised task with varying degrees of difficulty, ranging from very subtle to more prominent structural differences.</p>

  <p>Regarding CutPaste, as far as we know, it was uploaded to arXiv on April 8, 2021, about one month after the MICCAI submission deadline. There are several major differences. CutPaste takes a patch from one image and moves it to a new location in the same image, whereas PII combines patches from different images, creating more variety of combinations, which are more specific to medical imaging problems. CutPaste is a binary classification task at the image or patch level, whereas PII regresses different degrees of abnormality and directly predicts pixel-wise abnormality scores. As seen in the CutPaste experiments (Li et al., 2021), their method is suitable for detecting manufacturing defects such as cracks or scratches. However, many medical abnormalities, such as pneumonia, do not have sharp discontinuities. Meanwhile, congenital heart defects occur organically (during heart formation) which leads to cardiac structures that are very natural looking, albeit pathological. This is unlike breakages seen in manufacturing defects. PII is able to tackle these challenging cases by creating irregularities that are blended naturally into the surrounding context.</p>

  <p>We will modify the submission to clarify these points. The reviewers also make great suggestions for additional experiments and comparisons. Due to limited space in the current submission, we plan to follow these suggestions in future work.</p>
