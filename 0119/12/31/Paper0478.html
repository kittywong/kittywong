However, the auto-matic segmentation of melanoma is a very challenging task owing to the large variation of melanoma and ambiguous boundaries of lesion areas. While con-volutional neutral networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable progress in this task, most of existing solutions are still incapable of effectively capturing global dependencies to counteract the inductive bias caused by limited receptive fields.Recently, transformers have been proposed as a promising tool for global con-text modeling by employing a powerful global attention mechanism, but one oftheir main shortcomings when applied to segmentation tasks is that they can-not effectively extract sufficient local details to tackle ambiguous boundaries. We propose a novel boundary-aware transformer (BAT) to comprehensively addressthe challenges of automatic skin lesion segmentation. Specifically, we integrate a new boundary-wise attention gate (BAG) into transformers to enable the whole network to not only effectively model global long-range dependencies via trans-formers but also, simultaneously, capture more local details by making full use ofboundary-wise prior knowledge. Particularly, the auxiliary supervision of BAG is capable of assisting transformers to learn position embedding as it provides much spatial information. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed BAT and experiments corroborate its effectiveness, consistently outper-forming state-of-the-art methods in two famous datasets.

Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html This paper proposes a boundary-aware transformer for skin lesion segmentation. To capture the global features, the authors employ a powerful global attention mechanism to enhance the ability of feature extraction. In detail, a encoder network is first adapted, followed by a transformer architecture. Then, a prediction map is restored from a designed decoder. To tackle ambiguous lesion boundaries, the authors integrate a novel boundary-wise attention gate (BAG) into transformer to enable the whole network to learn global and local features. Overall, this paper is good. My major concerns are as follows: Why does the method use CNN-based backbone to extract features, rather than the radical transformer, just like as ViT. As illustrated in abstract and introduction, it is important to capture local information, suddicient local details is dropped by the strides and pooling operations in the CNN-based network.

Why do not directly set boundary pixels with low gradient magnitude as ambiguous boundary pixels? 5) How large is the patch size in image sequentialization? 6) Since this paper focuses on the boundary, using the Hausdorff distance as an additional evaluation metric could make the result more convincive.

To capture the global features, the authors employ a powerful global attention mechanism to enhance the ability of feature extraction. In detail, a encoder network is first adapted, followed by a transformer architecture. Then, a prediction map is restored from a designed decoder. To tackle ambiguous lesion boundaries, the authors integrate a novel boundary-wise attention gate (BAG) into transformer to enable the whole network to learn global and local features. Overall, this paper is good. My major concerns are as follows: Why does the method use CNN-based backbone to extract features, rather than the radical transformer, just like as ViT. As illustrated in abstract and introduction, it is important to capture local information, suddicient local details is dropped by the strides and pooling operations in the CNN-based network. Therefore, why does the proposed method persist in CNN-based backbone What is the position embedding in this proposed method, and how to initialize it ?

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopy images is of great impor-tance for improving the quantitative analysis of skin cancer. However, the auto-matic segmentation of melanoma is a very challenging task owing to the large variation  of  melanoma  and  ambiguous  boundaries  of  lesion  areas.  While  con-volutional neutral networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable progress in this task, most of existing solutions are still incapable of effectively capturing global dependencies to counteract the inductive bias caused by limited receptive fields.Recently, transformers have been proposed as a promising tool for global con-text modeling by employing a powerful global attention mechanism, but one oftheir  main  shortcomings  when  applied  to  segmentation  tasks  is  that  they  can-not effectively extract sufficient local details to tackle ambiguous boundaries. We propose a novel boundary-aware transformer (BAT) to comprehensively addressthe challenges of automatic skin lesion segmentation. Specifically, we integrate a new boundary-wise attention gate (BAG) into transformers to enable the whole network to not only effectively model global long-range dependencies via trans-formers but also, simultaneously, capture more local details by making full use ofboundary-wise prior knowledge. Particularly, the auxiliary supervision of BAG is capable of assisting transformers to learn position embedding as it provides much spatial information. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed BAT and experiments corroborate its effectiveness, consistently outper-forming state-of-the-art methods in two famous datasets.

      <p>1.The paper: ‘‘CA-Net: Comprehensive Attention Convolutional Neural Networks for Explainable Medical Image Segmentation’’ gets the results on ISIC2018 of dice（92.08%） which is the state of art result than the proposed method(91.2%). The superiority of the method need to be reconfirmed.
2.We are quite familiar with method CE-Net and our result using that on the ISIC2018 is 92.2% for Dice. The superiority of the method need to be reconfirmed.
3.Again on the experiments, ISIC2016 and ISIC2018 may have the similary data distribution, the mehtod may not be robust on other skin datasets.
4.The baseline in the ablation study is not clear.</p>

      <p>This paper proposes a novel boundary-aware transformer for skin lesion segmentation.</p>

      <p>Strengths:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This paper novelty is to integrate a new boundary-wise attention gate in a transformer architecture, to overcome some problems that are specific to medical images, and to capture local details.</li>
        <li>Detailed comparison to SotA transformer based methods and ablations study are provided and show convincing results.</li>
        <li>Paper is well written.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Weaknesses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are a few clarity issues or questions that can be addressed (please see each of the reviewer’s comments)</li>
        <li>The authors might want to refer a reference that is related to the SotA concerning skin segmentation (as suggested by Rev #1).</li>
