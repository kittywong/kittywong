<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Shawn Mathew, Saad Nadeem, Arie Kaufman Abstract Haustral folds are colon wall protrusions implicated for high polyp miss rate during optical colonoscopy procedures. If segmented accurately, haustral folds can allow for better estimation of missed surface and can also serve as valuable landmarks for registering pre-treatment CT (virtual) and optical colonoscopies, to guide navigation towards the detected anomalies. We present a novel generative adversarial network for feature-consistent image translation of optical colonoscopy videos to virtual colonoscopy renderings with haustral fold overlays. A new loss is introduced that utilizes a three-step cycle in order to leverage ground truth information between haustral fold annotations and virtual colonoscopy renderings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on real challenging optical colonoscopy videos as well as on textured virtual colonoscopy videos with clinician-verified haustral fold annotations. All code and scripts to reproduce the experiments of this paper will be made available via our Computational Endoscopy Platform at https://github.com/nadeemlab/CEP.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Haustral folds are colon wall protrusions implicated for high polyp miss rate during optical colonoscopy procedures. If segmented accurately, haustral folds can allow for better estimation of missed surface and can also serve as valuable landmarks for registering pre-treatment CT (virtual) and optical colonoscopies, to guide navigation towards the detected anomalies. We present a novel generative adversarial network for feature-consistent image translation of optical colonoscopy videos to virtual colonoscopy renderings with haustral fold overlays. A new loss is introduced that utilizes a three-step cycle in order to leverage ground truth information between haustral fold annotations and virtual colonoscopy renderings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on real challenging optical colonoscopy videos as well as on textured virtual colonoscopy videos with clinician-verified haustral fold annotations. All code and scripts to reproduce the experiments of this paper will be made available via our Computational Endoscopy Platform at https://github.com/nadeemlab/CEP.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The paper proposed a generative adversarial network, FoldIt, for feature-consistent image translation of optical colonoscopy videos to virtual colonoscopy renderings with haustral fold overlays.
Its applications include: better estimation of missed surface; benefit to register pre-treatment CT (virtual) and optical colonoscopies.</p>
    </blockquote>

  <li><strong>Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1) This task has good clinical application value.
2) It is novel to perform haustral folds segmentation based on the image translation methods.
3) The experimental designs well show the superiority of the proposed methods.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1) Only XDCycleGAN attended the comparisons, more comparisons would be much better. 
2) In the technical part, the key idea is cycleGAN which is existing. (Although the novelty seems limited, it will not affect the contribution. )</p>

          <p>The three-step cycle consistency loss and use of the common VC domain: Domain gap when training on synthetic data and testing on real data is one of the main challenges in medical imaging and deep learning research in general. This paper utilises the common VC domain which the OC and VC are translated into and compared in. This seems effective in training the network using the synthetic data with ground truth and real data without ground truth.</p>
