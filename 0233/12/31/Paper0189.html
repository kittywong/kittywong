Here, it is important to distinguish time-variant (e.g., longitudinal measures) and time-invariant (e.g., gender) components to analyze them individually. For this, we propose an innovative and ground-breaking Disentangled Sequential Graph Autoencoder which leverages the Sequential Variational Autoencoder (SVAE), graph convolution and semi-supervising framework together to learn a latent space composed of time-variant and time-invariant latent variables to characterize disentangled representation of the measurements over the entire ROIs. Incorporating target information in the decoder with a supervised loss let us achieve more effective representation learning towards improved classification. We validate our proposed method on the longitudinal cortical thickness data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Our method outperforms baselines with traditional techniques demonstrating benefits for effective longitudinal data representation for predicting labels and longitudinal data generation.

With this model, the author claims to encode both time-variant/invariant factors of network topologies as beneficial to longitudinal studies, e.g. for AD progressions. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. In general, this paper explicitly addresses technical details with mathematical explanations of each framework component, making this paper easy to understand. It also introduces a semi-supervised model in an end-to-end learning fashion and combines two types of brain structural measurements, i.e. DTI connections and cortical surface morphometry, which leverage multimodal learning. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Though the method is straightforward, there are still a couple of things in the experiments I would like to see more discussions: According to Fig. 2/3, some key information was missing. For example, what is the color bar indicates? Rather than the absolute reconstruction patterns, I would prefer an error heat map. Besides, to me, the timestamps t_0~t_4 are ordered along with disease progression, however, it is strange to see similar patterns for t_0/t_2 and t_1/t_4. That is confusing. Any comment? The author tries to extract the time-variant factor using the proposed model. But in the experiment setting, they deliberately average all DTI networks for all groups, which significantly smooth the longitudinal information. That reduces the contribution of involving network data. In addition, why do you just use 1-hop graph convolution? In quantitative analysis, the architecture of the baseline models is not properly designed, leading to bias judgment. For example, the supervised version of S3VAE could also be easily modified into semi-supervised learning as in Eq.3, rather than two-stage learning. Meanwhile, it is hard to tell the improvement comes from graph convolution or variational sequential encoding, hence an ablation study with a clear discussion is much needed. I think this piece of information would assist to build a solid conclusion of the true contributions of this study.

The paper proposes an autoencoder-based framework for disentanglement of time-varying and time-independent information, with application to modeling multimodal variability in Alzheimer’s disease. This joint use of disentanglement and graph convolution is recognised as novel by the reviewers. The main criticism is about the lack of thorough experimental validation, and assessment of the quality of the results, which makes it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion about the solidity of the contribution. The authors reply focuses on the fact that no model in the state of the art similar to the one here proposed, and the modification of the currently existing S3VAE would deviate too much from the original state of the art approach. Other clarifications on the experimental data and accuracy measures are also provided. The overall conclusion is that the work still lacks of a convincing experimental validation. Very little is shown about the disentanglement properties, and on how that time-variant and time-invariant features are handled and modelled. An ablation study would be also important to identify the value of each component on the framework. Finally, the reproducibility of the work appears to be low, model parameters and experimental choices are not clearly illustrated and justified in the text. After you have reviewed the rebuttal, please provide your final rating based on all reviews and the authors’ rebuttal. Reject What is the rank of this paper among all your rebuttal papers?

We try our best to flesh out all the concerns. Q1 (Rev #1) Reconstruction RMSE small but classification accuracy not necessarily high? A: The objective function in Eq. 4 consists of two terms. The first term focuses on reconstruction given label information, while the second is for classification performance. The hyperparameter α balances these two terms, thus, there is a trade-off between the reconstruction and classification. Furthermore, the reconstruction is conditional on the label information but does not model the label, and the label is considered only in the second term which directly handles classification. Thus, a better reconstruction does not necessarily guarantee a better classification. Q2 (Rev #2) Baseline architecture not properly designed leading to biased judgment. A: To the best of our knowledge, there is no semi-supervised sequential variational auto-encoder (SVAE) model proposed before this paper. Our model is the first approach considering the semi-supervised learning in SVAE. Reviewer did mention that S3VAE can be modified into the semi-supervised learning, however, there are two foreseeable issues with this. First, designing an architecture for the model label information is not trivial, one way is to build another MLP with softmax to directly model the relation between label and latent representations and keep the S3VAE structure. We actually tried this experiment, but unfortunately, both reconstruction and classification performances were worse than those of two-stage learning. Second, if we made significant modifications on the S3VAE to make it sufficiently suitable for our target, it is hard to say that S3VAE is still a baseline, as it would indeed be a newly proposed model. Q3 (Rev #2) Question on similar patterns for t_0/t_2 and t_1/t_3 in Fig 2/3. A: As we applied image processing (tissue segmentation and surface reconstruction) for each time point separately, it is possible that the change of cortical thickness is not consistent along time in some subjects. However, the average change of cortical thickness looks consistent along the neurodegeneration stage in our dataset. To avoid confusion, we will replace the individual result with average reconstruction results in the final version. Q4 (Rev #2) What is the color bar indicating? A: The color bar represents raw measures on the ROIs. We considered the error heat map before, but it is hard to visualize the difference, as the error is very small. Q5 (Rev #2) Why average DTI networks for all groups. A: Graph structure is assumed to be static and shared across all groups as we leverage global graph structure to robustly learn the disentangled latent structure to model the dynamics on the ROIs rather than the DTI networks. Q6 (Rev #1 / #3) Missing details of the dataset. A: The dataset includes 140 subjects with the Pre-AD group (93 subjects/330 records) and the Pro-AD group (47 subjects/170 records). The mean (std) of ages and sex ratio (Male:Famale) in Pre_AD group and Pro_AD group are 74.02(6.72)/ (185:145) and 74.87(6.92)/ (95:75), respectively. We will add this information in the later version. Q7 (Rev #1 / #3) Use of accuracy as classification performance measurement. A: Accuracy is a standard measure, and our training set (100 subjects) is relatively balanced with a ratio of 68: 32 between Pre/Pro AD groups. We will consider Precision and Recall as well in the later version. Q8 (Rev #3) Concern that the comparison with S3VAE may not be fair. A: We think two-stage learning with S3VAE is a reasonable baseline. As Rev #3 pointed out, we use the graph convolution in the model while S3VAE only depends on “naive neural network” without the graph. Therefore, comparing the model results between our model with S3VAE indeed demonstrates that leveraging graph information and integral learning structure (not two stage learning) are useful. back to top" />

After you have reviewed the rebuttal, please provide your final rating based on all reviews and the authors’ rebuttal. Reject What is the rank of this paper among all your rebuttal papers? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 16 Author Feedback We sincerely thank the reviewers for their thoughtful feedback as they will substantially help improve this paper. We try our best to flesh out all the concerns. Q1 (Rev #1) Reconstruction RMSE small but classification accuracy not necessarily high? A: The objective function in Eq. 4 consists of two terms. The first term focuses on reconstruction given label information, while the second is for classification performance. The hyperparameter α balances these two terms, thus, there is a trade-off between the reconstruction and classification. Furthermore, the reconstruction is conditional on the label information but does not model the label, and the label is considered only in the second term which directly handles classification. Thus, a better reconstruction does not necessarily guarantee a better classification. Q2 (Rev #2) Baseline architecture not properly designed leading to biased judgment. A: To the best of our knowledge, there is no semi-supervised sequential variational auto-encoder (SVAE) model proposed before this paper. Our model is the first approach considering the semi-supervised learning in SVAE. Reviewer did mention that S3VAE can be modified into the semi-supervised learning, however, there are two foreseeable issues with this. First, designing an architecture for the model label information is not trivial, one way is to build another MLP with softmax to directly model the relation between label and latent representations and keep the S3VAE structure. We actually tried this experiment, but unfortunately, both reconstruction and classification performances were worse than those of two-stage learning. Second, if we made significant modifications on the S3VAE to make it sufficiently suitable for our target, it is hard to say that S3VAE is still a baseline, as it would indeed be a newly proposed model. Q3 (Rev #2) Question on similar patterns for t_0/t_2 and t_1/t_3 in Fig 2/3. A: As we applied image processing (tissue segmentation and surface reconstruction) for each time point separately, it is possible that the change of cortical thickness is not consistent along time in some subjects. However, the average change of cortical thickness looks consistent along the neurodegeneration stage in our dataset. To avoid confusion, we will replace the individual result with average reconstruction results in the final version. Q4 (Rev #2) What is the color bar indicating? A: The color bar represents raw measures on the ROIs. We considered the error heat map before, but it is hard to visualize the difference, as the error is very small. Q5 (Rev #2) Why average DTI networks for all groups. A: Graph structure is assumed to be static and shared across all groups as we leverage global graph structure to robustly learn the disentangled latent structure to model the dynamics on the ROIs rather than the DTI networks. Q6 (Rev #1 / #3) Missing details of the dataset. A: The dataset includes 140 subjects with the Pre-AD group (93 subjects/330 records) and the Pro-AD group (47 subjects/170 records). The mean (std) of ages and sex ratio (Male:Famale) in Pre_AD group and Pro_AD group are 74.02(6.72)/ (185:145) and 74.87(6.92)/ (95:75), respectively. We will add this information in the later version. Q7 (Rev #1 / #3) Use of accuracy as classification performance measurement. A: Accuracy is a standard measure, and our training set (100 subjects) is relatively balanced with a ratio of 68: 32 between Pre/Pro AD groups. We will consider Precision and Recall as well in the later version. Q8 (Rev #3) Concern that the comparison with S3VAE may not be fair. A: We think two-stage learning with S3VAE is a reasonable baseline. As Rev #3 pointed out, we use the graph convolution in the model while S3VAE only depends on “naive neural network” without the graph. Therefore, comparing the model results between our model with S3VAE indeed demonstrates that leveraging graph information and integral learning structure (not two stage learning) are useful. back to top" />

Here, it is important to distinguish time-variant (e.g., longitudinal measures) and time-invariant (e.g., gender) components to analyze them individually. For this, we propose an innovative and ground-breaking Disentangled Sequential Graph Autoencoder which leverages the Sequential Variational Autoencoder (SVAE), graph convolution and semi-supervising framework together to learn a latent space composed of time-variant and time-invariant latent variables to characterize disentangled representation of the measurements over the entire ROIs. Incorporating target information in the decoder with a supervised loss let us achieve more effective representation learning towards improved classification. We validate our proposed method on the longitudinal cortical thickness data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Our method outperforms baselines with traditional techniques demonstrating benefits for effective longitudinal data representation for predicting labels and longitudinal data generation.

Why the reconstruction root mean square error is small, and the classification accuracy is not necessarily high, such as the results of the first and second rows in Table 1. It is not enough to measure classification performance only by accuracy. Why is there no sensitivity and specificity?

Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance This study lacks a detailed introduction of model parameter settings, which is difficult to reproduce Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors.

With this model, the author claims to encode both time-variant/invariant factors of network topologies as beneficial to longitudinal studies, e.g. for AD progressions. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. In general, this paper explicitly addresses technical details with mathematical explanations of each framework component, making this paper easy to understand. It also introduces a semi-supervised model in an end-to-end learning fashion and combines two types of brain structural measurements, i.e. DTI connections and cortical surface morphometry, which leverage multimodal learning. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Though the method is straightforward, there are still a couple of things in the experiments I would like to see more discussions: According to Fig. 2/3, some key information was missing. For example, what is the color bar indicates? Rather than the absolute reconstruction patterns, I would prefer an error heat map. Besides, to me, the timestamps t_0~t_4 are ordered along with disease progression, however, it is strange to see similar patterns for t_0/t_2 and t_1/t_4. That is confusing. Any comment? The author tries to extract the time-variant factor using the proposed model. But in the experiment setting, they deliberately average all DTI networks for all groups, which significantly smooth the longitudinal information. That reduces the contribution of involving network data. In addition, why do you just use 1-hop graph convolution? In quantitative analysis, the architecture of the baseline models is not properly designed, leading to bias judgment. For example, the supervised version of S3VAE could also be easily modified into semi-supervised learning as in Eq.3, rather than two-stage learning. Meanwhile, it is hard to tell the improvement comes from graph convolution or variational sequential encoding, hence an ablation study with a clear discussion is much needed. I think this piece of information would assist to build a solid conclusion of the true contributions of this study. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance No code been found, but I think the whole pipeline is clear to follow.

Lack of enough convincing evidence in experiments to draw a positive conclusion of its novelty. What is the ranking of this paper in your review stack? 3 Number of papers in your stack 5 Reviewer confidence Very confident Review #3 Please describe the contribution of the paper The paper proposed a sequential graph variational autoencoder (VAE) that separates time variant and invariant data. The VAE is semi supervised.The graph is built from an atlas (Destrieux atlas) with 148 brain regions. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. Inclusion of ROI graph in the sequential graph VAE is a novel contribution. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Many details on the data are not given. How many subjects in each group after mergiing to get two groups? How many timepoints? What is the time varying information (is it cortical thickness?) and the static data? Is there imbalance? Which data are unsupervised? Evaluation metrics are RMSE (for reconstruction) and accuracy (for classification). Accuracy is not a good measure if there is class imbalance. As the authors acknowledge, autoencoders that disentangle time variant and invariant data is not new. The new part seems to be the graph convolutions part. Authors should provide experimental evaluation that using the graph convolution is useful. The comparison with S3VAE may noy be fair. They depend on the “naive neural network” that was used and which is not explained.

The paper proposes an autoencoder-based framework for disentanglement of time-varying and time-independent information, with application to modeling multimodal variability in Alzheimer’s disease. This joint use of disentanglement and graph convolution is recognised as novel by the reviewers. The main criticism is about the lack of thorough experimental validation, and assessment of the quality of the results, which makes it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion about the solidity of the contribution. The authors reply focuses on the fact that no model in the state of the art similar to the one here proposed, and the modification of the currently existing S3VAE would deviate too much from the original state of the art approach. Other clarifications on the experimental data and accuracy measures are also provided. The overall conclusion is that the work still lacks of a convincing experimental validation. Very little is shown about the disentanglement properties, and on how that time-variant and time-invariant features are handled and modelled. An ablation study would be also important to identify the value of each component on the framework. Finally, the reproducibility of the work appears to be low, model parameters and experimental choices are not clearly illustrated and justified in the text. After you have reviewed the rebuttal, please provide your final rating based on all reviews and the authors’ rebuttal. Reject What is the rank of this paper among all your rebuttal papers?

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Given a population longitudinal neuroimaging measurements defined on a brain network, exploiting temporal dependencies within the sequence of data and corresponding latent variables defined on the graph (i.e., network encoding relationships between regions of interest (ROI)) can highly benefit characterizing the brain. Here, it is important to distinguish time-variant (e.g., longitudinal measures) and time-invariant (e.g., gender) components to analyze them individually. For this, we propose an innovative and ground-breaking Disentangled Sequential Graph Autoencoder which leverages the Sequential Variational Autoencoder (SVAE), graph convolution and semi-supervising framework together to learn a latent space composed of time-variant and time-invariant latent variables to characterize disentangled representation of the measurements over the entire ROIs. Incorporating target information in the decoder with a supervised loss let us achieve more effective representation learning towards improved classification. We validate our proposed method on the longitudinal cortical thickness data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Our method outperforms baselines with traditional techniques demonstrating benefits for effective longitudinal data representation for predicting labels and longitudinal data generation.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In this work, the author designed a deep framework to deal with brain network representation learning by incorporating variational auto-encoder. With this model, the author claims to encode both time-variant/invariant factors of network topologies as beneficial to longitudinal studies, e.g. for AD progressions.</p>
    </blockquote>

  <li><strong>Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In general, this paper explicitly addresses technical details with mathematical explanations of each framework component, making this paper easy to understand.
It also introduces a semi-supervised model in an end-to-end learning fashion and combines two types of brain structural measurements, i.e. DTI connections and cortical surface morphometry, which leverage multimodal learning.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Though the method is straightforward, there are still a couple of things in the experiments I would like to see more discussions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>According to Fig. 2/3, some key information was missing. For example, what is the color bar indicates? Rather than the absolute reconstruction patterns, I would prefer an error heat map.</li>
        <li>Besides, to me, the timestamps t_0~t_4 are ordered along with disease progression, however, it is strange to see similar patterns for t_0/t_2 and t_1/t_4. That is confusing. Any comment?</li>
        <li>The author tries to extract the time-variant factor using the proposed model. But in the experiment setting, they deliberately average all DTI networks for all groups, which significantly smooth the longitudinal information. That reduces the contribution of involving network data. In addition, why do you just use 1-hop graph convolution?</li>
        <li>In quantitative analysis, the architecture of the baseline models is not properly designed, leading to bias judgment. For example, the supervised version of S3VAE could also be easily modified into semi-supervised learning as in Eq.3, rather than two-stage learning. Meanwhile, it is hard to tell the improvement comes from graph convolution or variational sequential encoding, hence an ablation study with a clear discussion is much needed. I think this piece of information would assist to build a solid conclusion of the true contributions of this study.</li>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Many details on the data are not given. How many subjects in each group after mergiing to get two groups?  How many timepoints? What is the time varying information (is it cortical thickness?) and the static data? Is there imbalance? Which data are unsupervised? 
Evaluation metrics are RMSE (for reconstruction) and accuracy (for classification). 
Accuracy is not a good measure if there is class imbalance.
As the authors acknowledge, autoencoders that disentangle time variant and invariant data is not new. The new part seems to be the graph convolutions part. Authors should provide experimental evaluation that using the graph convolution is useful. The comparison with S3VAE may noy be fair. They depend on the “naive neural network” that was used and which is not explained.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The paper proposes an autoencoder-based framework for disentanglement of time-varying and time-independent information, with application to modeling multimodal variability in Alzheimer’s disease. This joint use of disentanglement and graph convolution is recognised as novel by the reviewers. The main criticism is about the lack of thorough experimental validation, and assessment of the quality of the results, which makes it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion about the solidity of the contribution.<br />
The authors reply focuses on the fact that no model in the state of the art similar to the one here proposed, and the modification of the currently existing S3VAE would deviate too much from the original state of the art approach. Other clarifications on the experimental data and accuracy measures are also provided. 
The overall conclusion is that the work still lacks of a convincing experimental validation. Very little is shown about the disentanglement properties, and on how that time-variant and time-invariant features are handled and modelled. An ablation study would be also important to identify the value of each component on the framework. Finally, the reproducibility of the work appears to be low, model parameters and experimental choices are not clearly illustrated and justified in the text.</p>

<h1 id="authorFeedback-id">Author Feedback</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>We sincerely thank the reviewers for their thoughtful feedback as they will substantially help improve this paper. We try our best to flesh out all the concerns.
Q1 (Rev #1) Reconstruction RMSE small but classification accuracy not necessarily high?
A: The objective function in Eq. 4 consists of two terms. The first term focuses on reconstruction given label information, while the second is for classification performance. The hyperparameter α balances these two terms, thus, there is a trade-off between the reconstruction and classification. Furthermore, the reconstruction is conditional on the label information but does not model the label, and the label is considered only in the second term which directly handles classification. Thus, a better reconstruction does not necessarily guarantee a better classification.
Q2 (Rev #2) Baseline architecture not properly designed leading to biased judgment.
A: To the best of our knowledge, there is no semi-supervised sequential variational auto-encoder (SVAE) model proposed before this paper. Our model is the first approach considering the semi-supervised learning in SVAE. Reviewer did mention that S3VAE can be modified into the semi-supervised learning, however, there are two foreseeable issues with this. First, designing an architecture for the model label information is not trivial, one way is to build another MLP with softmax to directly model the relation between label and latent representations and keep the S3VAE structure. We actually tried this experiment, but unfortunately, both reconstruction and classification performances were worse than those of two-stage learning. Second, if we made significant modifications on the S3VAE to make it sufficiently suitable for our target, it is hard to say that S3VAE is still a baseline, as it would indeed be a newly proposed model.
Q3 (Rev #2) Question on similar patterns for t_0/t_2 and t_1/t_3 in Fig 2/3.
A: As we applied image processing (tissue segmentation and surface reconstruction) for each time point separately, it is possible that the change of cortical thickness is not consistent along time in some subjects. However, the average change of cortical thickness looks consistent along the neurodegeneration stage in our dataset. To avoid confusion, we will replace the individual result with average reconstruction results in the final version. 
Q4 (Rev #2) What is the color bar indicating?
A: The color bar represents raw measures on the ROIs. We considered the error heat map before, but it is hard to visualize the difference, as the error is very small.
Q5 (Rev #2) Why average DTI networks for all groups.
A: Graph structure is assumed to be static and shared across all groups as we leverage global graph structure to robustly learn the disentangled latent structure to model the dynamics on the ROIs rather than the DTI networks.
Q6 (Rev #1 / #3) Missing details of the dataset.
A: The dataset includes 140 subjects with the Pre-AD group (93 subjects/330 records) and the Pro-AD group (47 subjects/170 records). The mean (std) of ages and sex ratio (Male:Famale) in Pre_AD group and Pro_AD group are 74.02(6.72)/ (185:145) and 74.87(6.92)/ (95:75), respectively. We will add this information in the later version. 
Q7 (Rev #1 / #3) Use of accuracy as classification performance measurement.
A: Accuracy is a standard measure, and our training set (100 subjects) is relatively balanced with a ratio of 68: 32 between Pre/Pro AD groups. We will consider Precision and Recall as well in the later version.
Q8 (Rev #3) Concern that the comparison with S3VAE may not be fair.
A: We think two-stage learning with S3VAE is a reasonable baseline. As Rev #3 pointed out, we use the graph convolution in the model while S3VAE only depends on “naive neural network” without the graph. Therefore, comparing the model results between our model with S3VAE indeed demonstrates that leveraging graph information and integral learning structure (not two stage learning) are useful.</p>
