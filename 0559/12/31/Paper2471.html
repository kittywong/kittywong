<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Apostolia Tsirikoglou, Karin Stacke, Gabriel Eilertsen, Jonas Unger Abstract The scarcity of labeled data is a major bottleneck for developing accurate and robust deep learning-based models for histopathology applications. The problem is notably prominent for the task of metastasis detection in lymph nodes, due to the tissue’s low tumor-to-non-tumor ratio, resulting in labor- and time-intensive annotation processes for the pathologists. This work explores alternatives on how to augment the training data for colon carcinoma metastasis detection when there is limited or no representation of the target domain. Through an exhaustive study of cross-validated experiments with limited training data availability, we evaluate both an inter-organ approach utilizing already available data for other tissues, and an intra-organ approach, utilizing the primary tumor. Both these approaches result in little to no extra annotation effort. Our results show that these data augmentation strategies can be an efficient way of increasing accuracy on metastasis detection, but fore-most increase robustness.

Both an inter-organ approach utilising already available data for other tissues, and an intra-organ approach, utilising the primary tumour were explored. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The paper is well written, the methods chosen for data augmentation are common in the field; A very important problem of dealing with limited datasets through data augmentation is studied; Interesting and systematic experiments were conducted. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.

What is the ranking of this paper in your stack? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 2 Author Feedback We would like to thank the reviewers for their comments and the provisional acceptance recommendation. We will address the main points they indicated to improve the main and supplementary manuscripts. Regarding datasets and Cycle-GAN training details, as well as the sampling strategy: • We refer the reviewers and the readers to the supplementary document for details on the datasets and the experimental setup. Table 1 in the supplementary material shows the number of patch images for the training and testing sets of colon, breast, and skin datasets. In specific, the 37 patients of the colon adenocarcinoma dataset correspond to 119,474 tumor and 149,580 non-tumor patch images. These 37 patients were randomly split into 32 patients for training and 5 for testing. Table 2 in the supplementary document provides further details on the train and test sets, as well as on the limited training data sub-sets, of the colon adenocarcinoma dataset regarding the number of patch images both in total (tumor/non-tumor) pre- and post-class balancing, and in specific per location source (hospital) and lymph node tumor, primary tumor and non-tumor patches pre- and post-class balancing. We will complement the datasets description with details on whole slide image numbers - however, we emphasize that training and evaluation performance were conducted on patch level - and with additional information for the breast and skin datasets. Unfortunately, apart from the hospital source, no other demographic details for the dataset cases are available. • We used one of the publicly available TensorFlow-1 implementations (https://github.com/vanhuyz/CycleGAN-TensorFlow) of the vanilla image-to-image translation network trained for 250,000 iterations for all experiments. We explored Cycle-GAN transformations in two ways: 1) per class (tumor/non-tumor) adaptations, and 2) one joint network for both of the classes. We will add the source code reference in the main paper, and complement the supplementary material with more Cycle-GAN domain transformation visual examples. • For the colon dataset, we sampled using a random uniform grid with 128 microns between the sample points. This corresponds to 256 pixels when sampling at a resolution of 0.5 microns (i.e., approximately 200 times magnification). We set the patch size to 256×256, meaning that the patches were sampled side-by-side without overlapping. In total, 269,054 patches from non-tumor, primary tumor, and lymph node tumor tissue were extracted. Each patch was assigned the label based on the annotation of the center pixel in the patch. The same sampling strategy was followed for the breast and skin datasets, resulting in 200,770 and 277,193 extracted patches respectively. We will add the sampling details to the supplementary document. Regarding reproducibility and scalability: • The deep classifier, implemented in TensorFlow-2, as well as all the trained models: 52 Cycle-GANs and 985 classifiers, i.e., (4 groups × 49 sub-sets experiments + 1 full-set experiment) × 5 runs - see Table 3 in the supplementary document, are available upon request. • Since the presented results are based on relative trends, we expect that the proposed intra- and inter-organ augmentation approaches will scale up with similar observations to other cancer types too. We believe that utilizing primary tumor and already available inter-organ data, combined with further research on optimal augmentations size, domain adaptation strategies, and/or other image synthesis methods will enable solutions of deep learning-based diagnostic tools for several cancer types where not a plethora of training data are available. back to top" />

We believe that utilizing primary tumor and already available inter-organ data, combined with further research on optimal augmentations size, domain adaptation strategies, and/or other image synthesis methods will enable solutions of deep learning-based diagnostic tools for several cancer types where not a plethora of training data are available. back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>The scarcity of labeled data is a major bottleneck for developing accurate and robust deep learning-based models for histopathology applications. The problem is notably prominent for the task of metastasis detection in lymph nodes, due to the tissue’s low tumor-to-non-tumor ratio, resulting in labor- and time-intensive annotation processes for the pathologists. This work explores alternatives on how to augment the training data for colon carcinoma metastasis detection when there is limited or no representation of the target domain. Through an exhaustive study of cross-validated experiments with limited training data availability, we evaluate both an inter-organ approach utilizing already available data for other tissues, and an intra-organ approach, utilizing the primary tumor. Both these approaches result in little to no extra annotation effort. Our results show that these data augmentation strategies can be an efficient way of increasing accuracy on metastasis detection, but fore-most increase robustness.

  <p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their comments and the provisional acceptance recommendation. We will address the main points they indicated to improve the main and supplementary manuscripts.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Regarding datasets and Cycle-GAN training details, as well as the sampling strategy:
• We refer the reviewers and the readers to the supplementary document for details on the datasets and the experimental setup. Table 1 in the supplementary material shows the number of patch images for the training and testing sets of colon, breast, and skin datasets. In specific, the 37 patients of the colon adenocarcinoma dataset correspond to 119,474 tumor and 149,580 non-tumor patch images. These 37 patients were randomly split into 32 patients for training and 5 for testing. Table 2 in the supplementary document provides further details on the train and test sets, as well as on the limited training data sub-sets, of the colon adenocarcinoma dataset regarding the number of patch images both in total (tumor/non-tumor) pre- and post-class balancing, and in specific per location source (hospital) and lymph node tumor, primary tumor and non-tumor patches pre- and post-class balancing. We will complement the datasets description with details on whole slide image numbers  - however, we emphasize that training and evaluation performance were conducted on patch level - and with additional information for the breast and skin datasets. Unfortunately, apart from the hospital source, no other demographic details for the dataset cases are available. 
• We used one of the publicly available TensorFlow-1 implementations (https://github.com/vanhuyz/CycleGAN-TensorFlow) of the vanilla image-to-image translation network trained for 250,000 iterations for all experiments. We explored Cycle-GAN transformations in two ways: 1) per class (tumor/non-tumor) adaptations, and 2) one joint network for both of the classes. We will add the source code reference in the main paper, and complement the supplementary material with more Cycle-GAN domain transformation visual examples. 
• For the colon dataset, we sampled using a random uniform grid with 128 microns between the sample points. This corresponds to 256 pixels when sampling at a resolution of 0.5 microns (i.e., approximately 200 times magnification). We set the patch size to 256×256, meaning that the patches were sampled side-by-side without overlapping. In total, 269,054 patches from non-tumor, primary tumor, and lymph node tumor tissue were extracted. Each patch was assigned the label based on the annotation of the center pixel in the patch. The same sampling strategy was followed for the breast and skin datasets, resulting in 200,770 and 277,193 extracted patches respectively. We will add the sampling details to the supplementary document.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Regarding reproducibility and scalability: 
• The deep classifier, implemented in TensorFlow-2, as well as all the trained models: 52 Cycle-GANs and 985 classifiers, i.e., (4 groups × 49 sub-sets experiments + 1 full-set experiment) × 5 runs - see Table 3 in the supplementary document, are available upon request.
• Since the presented results are based on relative trends, we expect that the proposed intra- and inter-organ augmentation approaches will scale up with similar observations to other cancer types too. We believe that utilizing primary tumor and already available inter-organ data, combined with further research on optimal augmentations size, domain adaptation strategies, and/or other image synthesis methods will enable solutions of deep learning-based diagnostic tools for several cancer types where not a plethora of training data are available.</p>
    </li>
