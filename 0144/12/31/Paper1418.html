<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Ke Wang, Shujun Liang, Yu Zhang Abstract Accurate lesion segmentation in breast ultrasound (BUS) images is of great significance for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. However, precise segmentation on missing/ambiguous boundaries or confusing regions remains challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel residual feedback network, which enhances the confidence of the inconclusive pixels to boost breast lesion segmentation performance. In the proposed residual feedback network, a residual representation module is introduced to learn the residual representation near missing/ambiguous boundaries and confusing regions, which promotes the network to make more efforts on those hardly-predicted pixels. Moreover, a residual feedback transmission strategy is designed to update the input of encoder by combining residual representation with original image features. This strategy could enhance the regions including hardly-predicted pixels, which makes the network can further correct the errors in segmentation. Experimental results on three datasets (3813 images in total) demonstrate that our proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html The paper addresses a strong clinical need of breast lesion segmentation to inform diagnosis and treatment. The technique produced has novelty—it improves the well-known encoder-decoder segmentation model. To remove ambiguity, it would be good for you to mention whether you are dealing with both benign and malignant lesions in your dataset. The breakdown of benign/malignant images should accompany your dataset description. It is well known that margins of benign lesions are much easier to figure out that the malignant ones and this could influence your results if the test set is skewed. Relatedly, although your results show marked improvement on state-of-the-art methods, there are clearly some outputs which are not perfect, but these are not well discussed. It is for example well known that some malignant lesions present with posterior acoustic shadowing, which would make delineation of the margin difficult. How does your model perform on these images? Although the writing style is generally good, it is important to address several typos and grammatical inconsistencies, for example: Introduction, second last line. Correct the sentence: “which makes the network can further correct the errors in seg-mentation,” and Paragraph 1 of 2.2 (Encoder-decoder baseline). Fig 1 should be improved to ensure that the text is easily discernible. Please state your overall opinion of the paper accept (8) Please justify your recommendation.

We appreciate that the key contributions of our work are affirmed by reviewers: 1) a novel approach for breast ultrasound lesion segmentation (all reviewers); 2) ‘the paper addresses a strong clinical need to inform diagnosis and treatment; the results are presented in good detail and show a step forward when compared to state-of-the-art methods’ (R1); 3) ‘the proposed requires no further parameters specifications to train the net’ (R2); 4) ‘good ablation experiment, good experiments, suitable novelty’(R3); 5) ‘the idea of estimating hardly-predicted pixels is novel’(R4). R1 suggests to mention the breakdown of benign/malignant images, discuss the failed/less accurate cases, and the malignant lesion with posterior acoustic shadowing. We apologize for the vague description in the paper. Indeed, we have dealt with both benign and malignant lesions in our dataset, which contains total 1623 benign and 2190 malignant lesions. In fact, we have shown the results of malignant lesion with posterior acoustic shadowing in the second row of Fig.3. The results show that our proposed model achieves superior performance in this case. We will also add some failed/less accurate cases in experiment section, which contains the mucus-like lesion companied with microcalcificaiton, and the poorly visible mucinous carcinoma. The details will be discussed in the final version. As suggested by R1, we will improve the quality of all figures. R2 concerns about a deep and formal discussion on the residual representation and how it helps to the task. More metrics will be added in Table 4 to explain the reasons. For example, employing the residual representation yields significant recall improvements (0.70%,1.99%,0.55% on datasetA, datasetB, datasetC). This achievement can be explained by learning the representations of missing/ambiguous boundaries and confusing regions in residual representation module, and encouraging the network to explore more information about hardly-predicted pixels. Further, observed from Table 4, training our model using the proposed residual feedback transmission strategy achieves more accurate segmentation results in terms of all metrics, especially on the boundary-related metric HD. It proves that the residual feedback transmission strategy, which feedbacks the learned representations into the encoder, can enhance the weight of regions including hardly-predicted pixels, and make the network iteratively correct the errors in segmentation. These discussions will be added in the revision. R3 suggests explaining the loss function especially residual representation loss. We used the weighted-balanced loss for segmentation and the weighted binary cross-entropy loss for residual representation module, which was proposed in our previous work[28] and adopted a weighted parameter to calculate the ratio of the number of foreground and background pixels (large differences in size between foreground and background areas, especially for residual representation). We will make this clear in the final version. R3 is confused about the test phase in our model. For each BUS image in the test phase, the segmentation results can be generated recurrently for more precise performance owning to the proposed feedback transmission strategy. These will be added in the revision. R4’s question is on how to obtain the results of dataset A in Table 1. Indeed, we perform the five-fold cross-validation on dataset A and report the validated results, then use dataset B and dataset C as two test datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model based on five models trained on dataset A. R2 and R4 require more information for reproducibility. We will release code and all segmentation results at GitHub and report the URL in final version. All reviewers point out that the language using in our paper should be improved. We will carefully revise the paper in the revision. back to top" />

We appreciate that the key contributions of our work are affirmed by reviewers: 1) a novel approach for breast ultrasound lesion segmentation (all reviewers); 2) ‘the paper addresses a strong clinical need to inform diagnosis and treatment; the results are presented in good detail and show a step forward when compared to state-of-the-art methods’ (R1); 3) ‘the proposed requires no further parameters specifications to train the net’ (R2); 4) ‘good ablation experiment, good experiments, suitable novelty’(R3); 5) ‘the idea of estimating hardly-predicted pixels is novel’(R4). R1 suggests to mention the breakdown of benign/malignant images, discuss the failed/less accurate cases, and the malignant lesion with posterior acoustic shadowing. We apologize for the vague description in the paper. Indeed, we have dealt with both benign and malignant lesions in our dataset, which contains total 1623 benign and 2190 malignant lesions. In fact, we have shown the results of malignant lesion with posterior acoustic shadowing in the second row of Fig.3. The results show that our proposed model achieves superior performance in this case. We will also add some failed/less accurate cases in experiment section, which contains the mucus-like lesion companied with microcalcificaiton, and the poorly visible mucinous carcinoma. The details will be discussed in the final version. As suggested by R1, we will improve the quality of all figures. R2 concerns about a deep and formal discussion on the residual representation and how it helps to the task. More metrics will be added in Table 4 to explain the reasons. For example, employing the residual representation yields significant recall improvements (0.70%,1.99%,0.55% on datasetA, datasetB, datasetC). This achievement can be explained by learning the representations of missing/ambiguous boundaries and confusing regions in residual representation module, and encouraging the network to explore more information about hardly-predicted pixels. Further, observed from Table 4, training our model using the proposed residual feedback transmission strategy achieves more accurate segmentation results in terms of all metrics, especially on the boundary-related metric HD. It proves that the residual feedback transmission strategy, which feedbacks the learned representations into the encoder, can enhance the weight of regions including hardly-predicted pixels, and make the network iteratively correct the errors in segmentation. These discussions will be added in the revision. R3 suggests explaining the loss function especially residual representation loss. We used the weighted-balanced loss for segmentation and the weighted binary cross-entropy loss for residual representation module, which was proposed in our previous work[28] and adopted a weighted parameter to calculate the ratio of the number of foreground and background pixels (large differences in size between foreground and background areas, especially for residual representation). We will make this clear in the final version. R3 is confused about the test phase in our model. For each BUS image in the test phase, the segmentation results can be generated recurrently for more precise performance owning to the proposed feedback transmission strategy. These will be added in the revision. R4’s question is on how to obtain the results of dataset A in Table 1. Indeed, we perform the five-fold cross-validation on dataset A and report the validated results, then use dataset B and dataset C as two test datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model based on five models trained on dataset A. R2 and R4 require more information for reproducibility. We will release code and all segmentation results at GitHub and report the URL in final version. All reviewers point out that the language using in our paper should be improved. We will carefully revise the paper in the revision. back to top" />

However, precise segmentation on missing/ambiguous boundaries or confusing regions remains challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel residual feedback network, which enhances the confidence of the inconclusive pixels to boost breast lesion segmentation performance. In the proposed residual feedback network, a residual representation module is introduced to learn the residual representation near missing/ambiguous boundaries and confusing regions, which promotes the network to make more efforts on those hardly-predicted pixels. Moreover, a residual feedback transmission strategy is designed to update the input of encoder by combining residual representation with original image features. This strategy could enhance the regions including hardly-predicted pixels, which makes the network can further correct the errors in segmentation. Experimental results on three datasets (3813 images in total) demonstrate that our proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

They employ a residual feedback network to learn pixel-level information and identify unclear boundaries and confusing regions that would otherwise be missed by previous approaches. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The authors describe a novel approach to the task of breast ultrasound lesion segmentation. There is a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art approaches, like U-net, Deep-Lab, CE-Net and S2P-Net. The proposed model shows an improved DSC, JI, Recall and Precision metrics compared to previous approaches. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. There is no discussion of failed/ less accurate cases. Various grammatical inconsistencies and typos exist in the paper, which sometimes make comprehension of the content difficult, for example, paragraph 1 of Section 2.2. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The dataset, network used, and the training details are well presented. However, the computational cost is not presented and there is no analysis of the results where the method has failed. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html The paper addresses a strong clinical need of breast lesion segmentation to inform diagnosis and treatment. The technique produced has novelty—it improves the well-known encoder-decoder segmentation model. To remove ambiguity, it would be good for you to mention whether you are dealing with both benign and malignant lesions in your dataset. The breakdown of benign/malignant images should accompany your dataset description. It is well known that margins of benign lesions are much easier to figure out that the malignant ones and this could influence your results if the test set is skewed. Relatedly, although your results show marked improvement on state-of-the-art methods, there are clearly some outputs which are not perfect, but these are not well discussed. It is for example well known that some malignant lesions present with posterior acoustic shadowing, which would make delineation of the margin difficult. How does your model perform on these images? Although the writing style is generally good, it is important to address several typos and grammatical inconsistencies, for example: Introduction, second last line. Correct the sentence: “which makes the network can further correct the errors in seg-mentation,” and Paragraph 1 of 2.2 (Encoder-decoder baseline). Fig 1 should be improved to ensure that the text is easily discernible. Please state your overall opinion of the paper accept (8) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? A novel method for breast lesion segmentation is presented, with strong relevance to the MIC community.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Accurate lesion segmentation in breast ultrasound (BUS) images is of great significance for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. However, precise segmentation on missing/ambiguous boundaries or confusing regions remains challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel residual feedback network, which enhances the confidence of the inconclusive pixels to boost breast lesion segmentation performance. In the proposed residual feedback network, a residual representation module is introduced to learn the residual representation near missing/ambiguous boundaries and confusing regions, which promotes the network to make more efforts on those hardly-predicted pixels. Moreover, a residual feedback transmission strategy is designed to update the input of encoder by combining residual representation with original image features. This strategy could enhance the regions including hardly-predicted pixels, which makes the network can further correct the errors in segmentation. Experimental results on three datasets (3813 images in total) demonstrate that our proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

    <blockquote>
      <p>The paper addresses a strong clinical need of breast lesion segmentation to inform diagnosis and treatment. 
The technique produced has novelty—it improves the well-known encoder-decoder segmentation model. 
To remove ambiguity, it would be good for you to mention whether you are dealing with both benign and malignant lesions in your dataset. The breakdown of benign/malignant images should accompany your dataset description. It is well known that margins of benign lesions are much easier to figure out that the malignant ones and this could influence your results if the test set is skewed. 
Relatedly, although your results show marked improvement on state-of-the-art methods, there are clearly some outputs which are not perfect, but these are not well discussed. It is for example well known that some malignant lesions present with posterior acoustic shadowing, which would make delineation of the margin difficult. How does your model perform on these images?
Although the writing style is generally good, it is important to address several typos and grammatical inconsistencies, for example: Introduction, second last line. Correct the sentence: “which makes the network can further correct the errors in seg-mentation,” and Paragraph 1 of 2.2 (Encoder-decoder baseline). 
Fig 1 should be improved to ensure that the text is easily discernible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We thank all the reviewers for their valuable comments. We appreciate that the key contributions of our work are affirmed by reviewers: 1) a novel approach for breast ultrasound lesion segmentation (all reviewers); 2) ‘the paper addresses a strong clinical need to inform diagnosis and treatment; the results are presented in good detail and show a step forward when compared to state-of-the-art methods’ (R1); 3) ‘the proposed requires no further parameters specifications to train the net’ (R2); 4) ‘good ablation experiment, good experiments, suitable novelty’(R3); 5) ‘the idea of estimating hardly-predicted pixels is novel’(R4).</p>

  <p>R1 suggests to mention the breakdown of benign/malignant images, discuss the failed/less accurate cases, and the malignant lesion with posterior acoustic shadowing. We apologize for the vague description in the paper. Indeed, we have dealt with both benign and malignant lesions in our dataset, which contains total 1623 benign and 2190 malignant lesions. In fact, we have shown the results of malignant lesion with posterior acoustic shadowing in the second row of Fig.3. The results show that our proposed model achieves superior performance in this case. We will also add some failed/less accurate cases in experiment section, which contains the mucus-like lesion companied with microcalcificaiton, and the poorly visible mucinous carcinoma. The details will be discussed in the final version.</p>

  <p>As suggested by R1, we will improve the quality of all figures.</p>

  <p>R2 concerns about a deep and formal discussion on the residual representation and how it helps to the task. More metrics will be added in Table 4 to explain the reasons. For example, employing the residual representation yields significant recall improvements (0.70%,1.99%,0.55% on datasetA, datasetB, datasetC). This achievement can be explained by learning the representations of missing/ambiguous boundaries and confusing regions in residual representation module, and encouraging the network to explore more information about hardly-predicted pixels. Further, observed from Table 4, training our model using the proposed residual feedback transmission strategy achieves more accurate segmentation results in terms of all metrics, especially on the boundary-related metric HD. It proves that the residual feedback transmission strategy, which feedbacks the learned representations into the encoder, can enhance the weight of regions including hardly-predicted pixels, and make the network iteratively correct the errors in segmentation. These discussions will be added in the revision.</p>

  <p>R3 suggests explaining the loss function especially residual representation loss. We used the weighted-balanced loss for segmentation and the weighted binary cross-entropy loss for residual representation module, which was proposed in our previous work[28] and adopted a weighted parameter to calculate the ratio of the number of foreground and background pixels (large differences in size between foreground and background areas, especially for residual representation).  We will make this clear in the final version.</p>

  <p>R3 is confused about the test phase in our model. For each BUS image in the test phase, the segmentation results can be generated recurrently for more precise performance owning to the proposed feedback transmission strategy. These will be added in the revision.</p>

  <p>R4’s question is on how to obtain the results of dataset A in Table 1. Indeed, we perform the five-fold cross-validation on dataset A and report the validated results, then use dataset B and dataset C as two test datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model based on five models trained on dataset A.</p>

  <p>R2 and R4 require more information for reproducibility. We will release code and all segmentation results at GitHub and report the URL in final version.</p>

  <p>All reviewers point out that the language using in our paper should be improved. We will carefully revise the paper in the revision.</p>
