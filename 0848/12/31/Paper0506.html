<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Zipei Zhao, Fengqian Pang, Zhiwen Liu, Chuyang Ye Abstract Cell detection in histopathology images is of great value in clinical practice. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to cell detection to improve the detection accuracy, where cell annotations are required for network training. However, due to the variety and large number of cells, complete annotations that include every cell of interest in the training images can be challenging. Usually, incomplete annotations can be achieved, where positive labeling results are carefully examined to ensure their reliability but there can be other positive instances, i.e., cells of interest, that are not included in the annotations. This annotation strategy leads to a lack of knowledge about true negative samples. Most existing methods simply treat instances that are not labeled as positive as truly negative during network training, which can adversely affect the network performance. In this work, to address the problem of incomplete annotations, we formulate the training of detection networks as a positive-unlabeled learning problem. Specifically, the classification loss in network training is revised to take into account incomplete annotations, where the terms corresponding to negative samples are approximated with the true positive samples and the other samples of which the labels are unknown. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were performed on a publicly available dataset for mitosis detection in breast cancer cells, and the experimental results show that our method improves the performance of cell detection given incomplete annotations for training.

Summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper and justify your recommendation. In case you deviate from the reviewers’ recommendations, explain in detail the reasons why. In case of an invitation for rebuttal, clarify which points are important to address in the rebuttal. The paper aims to solve the cell detection in histopathology images with incomplete annotations. The human labeled mitotic cells are true positives, while the rest is not treated as negatives (unlabeled instead). The reviewers confirm the value of this research problem, but raised some major concerns about the methodologies. For example, Positive-unlabeled learning has been used in object detection in the computer vision community. Rather than applying the method from one application domain to another application domain, what is the new methodological contribution? The comparison with the similar work [7] shows the improvement from the proposed work is very small in Table 1. The differences and advantages of the method compared to [7] need more detailed analysis. In Table 1, the performance varies a lot regarding different training-test dataset splits as well.

Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. The authors provided responses to some questions/comments raised by the reviewers. It would be better to describe the differences between the proposed PU-learning and a broad range of PU-learning related works to summarize the technical contributions beyond application domain contributions, rather than limiting the scope to one paper mentioned by the reviewer. The explanation about the significance of the small improvement (precision from 0.516 to 0.530, and recall from 0.759 to 0.771) did not convince the AC. Furthermore, in Table 1, the precision varies within [0.435, 0.567] and the recall varies within [0.670, 0.842], according to different folds. The small improvement is negligible, compared to the variance. After you have reviewed the rebuttal, please provide your final rating based on all reviews and the authors’ rebuttal.

If you disagree with some of the (meta)reviewer statements, you can indicate so in your meta-review. Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. Authors argue that Yang et al.

On the other hand, the submitted paper explicitly explores the detection problem when approximating p(x), leading to improved empirical results. The comparison with [7] in Tables 1 and 2 show statistically significant results, but the rebuttal does not explain the variation in results for different train/test splits. The differences with BDE are clarified in the rebuttal. Except for this last point, the authors provided a good rebuttal, and taking into accounting the initial positive reviews, I recommend the acceptance of the paper.

If you disagree with some of the (meta)reviewer statements, you can indicate so in your meta-review. Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. The paper proposes a loss function for Faster R-CNN in the context of cell detection in histopathology images with incomplete annotations. The method obtains modest empirical improvements with respect to [7] on a public dataset of mitosis detection. Although the technical novelty of the proposed approach is limited, the rebuttal adequately argues the differences with the missing reference pointed out by R5, which should be discussed in the text. The empirical improvement is not large in absolute terms, but its statistical significance is assessed. Other reviewer comments should be included in the final version of the paper.

We would like to thank R5 for providing the reference. However, we respectfully disagree that the novelty of our work is limited. Yang et al., BMVC 2020 simply apply the PU learning strategy developed for classification to the detection problem without noticing the difference between object detection and image classification. In particular, as argued on page 5 (before Eq. 10) in our paper, in classification problems the distribution p(x) of an arbitrary sample is directly approximated using the distribution p(x_u) of unlabeled samples. But this approximation is problematic in object detection, because positively labeled and unlabeled samples originate from the same images. In this approximation, the positively labeled samples are excluded from the approximated distribution and the approximation is biased. We notice that the combination of positively labeled and unlabeled samples can approximate p(x) and revise the PU learning framework for the detection problem, which leads to the novel approximation in Eq. 10. This improvement is confirmed by experimental results (not reported in the current draft). Specifically, with the naive approximation used by Yang et al., BMVC 2020, the average precision is reduced from 0.530 to 0.503, which is much worse than the BDE result (0.516) and close to the baseline result (0.501), and this reduction is consistently observed for each fold; the average recall is 0.770, which is no better than the result achieved with our revised strategy. Therefore, although we have used a PU learning strategy, it is adapted to the detection problem with important contributions and novelty designs. We will include these results and clarify the novelty of our method. R3 suggests that the improvement from BDE to our method is small. We respectfully disagree. As shown in Table 2, on average our method has improved both precision and recall (ranging from 0 to 1) by more than 0.01. Such improvement is common in papers on object or cell detection (e.g., see AP50 in Table 7 in Kemal Oksuz et al., NeurIPS 2020, Table 3 in Xizhou Zhu et al., ICLR 2021, or Table 4 in Chao Li et al., MedIA 2018). Moreover, the improvement is statistically significant. Also, we believe that our method provides a promising direction for cell detection with incomplete annotations. Even with a relatively simple PU learning strategy, we have already achieved the improvement. Our method can motivate further improvements with more advanced PU learning methods in future work. Reviewer 1 (R1) suggests explaining the difference between our method and BDE. BDE treats samples in unlabeled areas as negative samples, but their weights are adjusted according to whether they are truly negative. Our method treats samples in unlabeled areas as unknown classes, and the classification term associated with negative samples are approximated with both positive samples and these unlabeled samples using a principled framework. We will better clarify this. R1 suggests that other detection networks and backbones should be considered. On a related note, Reviewer 3 (R3) suggests that other state-of-the-art works can be compared. We have actually tested different backbones for Faster RCNN, where VGG16, ResNet50, and ResNet101 were considered. For all cases, the proposed method outperforms the baseline method and BDE. Due to page limit, we only reported the results achieved with the VGG16 backbone, as it is associated with the best baseline performance. We will clarify that the results were achieved with VGG16, and the improvement can also be observed for other backbones. Note that our method is agnostic to the network structure. Thus, we expect that it can also be integrated with other detection networks, such as Cascade RCNN. Such integration can be explored in future work. Other minor issues will also be addressed. back to top" />

BDE treats samples in unlabeled areas as negative samples, but their weights are adjusted according to whether they are truly negative. Our method treats samples in unlabeled areas as unknown classes, and the classification term associated with negative samples are approximated with both positive samples and these unlabeled samples using a principled framework. We will better clarify this. R1 suggests that other detection networks and backbones should be considered. On a related note, Reviewer 3 (R3) suggests that other state-of-the-art works can be compared. We have actually tested different backbones for Faster RCNN, where VGG16, ResNet50, and ResNet101 were considered. For all cases, the proposed method outperforms the baseline method and BDE. Due to page limit, we only reported the results achieved with the VGG16 backbone, as it is associated with the best baseline performance. We will clarify that the results were achieved with VGG16, and the improvement can also be observed for other backbones. Note that our method is agnostic to the network structure. Thus, we expect that it can also be integrated with other detection networks, such as Cascade RCNN. Such integration can be explored in future work. Other minor issues will also be addressed. back to top" />

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to cell detection to improve the detection accuracy, where cell annotations are required for network training. However, due to the variety and large number of cells, complete annotations that include every cell of interest in the training images can be challenging. Usually, incomplete annotations can be achieved, where positive labeling results are carefully examined to ensure their reliability but there can be other positive instances, i.e., cells of interest, that are not included in the annotations. This annotation strategy leads to a lack of knowledge about true negative samples. Most existing methods simply treat instances that are not labeled as positive as truly negative during network training, which can adversely affect the network performance. In this work, to address the problem of incomplete annotations, we formulate the training of detection networks as a positive-unlabeled learning problem. Specifically, the classification loss in network training is revised to take into account incomplete annotations, where the terms corresponding to negative samples are approximated with the true positive samples and the other samples of which the labels are unknown. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were performed on a publicly available dataset for mitosis detection in breast cancer cells, and the experimental results show that our method improves the performance of cell detection given incomplete annotations for training.

Seems a delta from [7] (BDE), and the improvement in both recall and precision is a delta from that one. The results show that there is a significant improvement from the baseline to BDE, however the improvement from BDE to this one is small. Therefore would classify this as a small delta contribution.

Summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper and justify your recommendation. In case you deviate from the reviewers’ recommendations, explain in detail the reasons why. In case of an invitation for rebuttal, clarify which points are important to address in the rebuttal. The paper aims to solve the cell detection in histopathology images with incomplete annotations. The human labeled mitotic cells are true positives, while the rest is not treated as negatives (unlabeled instead). The reviewers confirm the value of this research problem, but raised some major concerns about the methodologies. For example, Positive-unlabeled learning has been used in object detection in the computer vision community. Rather than applying the method from one application domain to another application domain, what is the new methodological contribution? The comparison with the similar work [7] shows the improvement from the proposed work is very small in Table 1. The differences and advantages of the method compared to [7] need more detailed analysis. In Table 1, the performance varies a lot regarding different training-test dataset splits as well. What is the ranking of this paper in your stack? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 5 Please provide your assessment of the paper taking all information into account, including rebuttal. Highlight the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper, clarify how you reconciled contrasting review comments and scores, indicate if concerns were successfully addressed in the rebuttal, and provide a clear justification of your decision. If you disagree with some of the (meta)reviewer statements, you can indicate so in your meta-review. Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. The authors provided responses to some questions/comments raised by the reviewers. It would be better to describe the differences between the proposed PU-learning and a broad range of PU-learning related works to summarize the technical contributions beyond application domain contributions, rather than limiting the scope to one paper mentioned by the reviewer. The explanation about the significance of the small improvement (precision from 0.516 to 0.530, and recall from 0.759 to 0.771) did not convince the AC. Furthermore, in Table 1, the precision varies within [0.435, 0.567] and the recall varies within [0.670, 0.842], according to different folds. The small improvement is negligible, compared to the variance. After you have reviewed the rebuttal, please provide your final rating based on all reviews and the authors’ rebuttal. Reject What is the rank of this paper among all your rebuttal papers? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 10 Meta-Review #2 Please provide your assessment of the paper taking all information into account, including rebuttal. Highlight the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper, clarify how you reconciled contrasting review comments and scores, indicate if concerns were successfully addressed in the rebuttal, and provide a clear justification of your decision. If you disagree with some of the (meta)reviewer statements, you can indicate so in your meta-review. Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. Authors argue that Yang et al. (BMVC’2020)apply PU learning for detection without noticing the difference between classification and detection. On the other hand, the submitted paper explicitly explores the detection problem when approximating p(x), leading to improved empirical results. The comparison with [7] in Tables 1 and 2 show statistically significant results, but the rebuttal does not explain the variation in results for different train/test splits. The differences with BDE are clarified in the rebuttal. Except for this last point, the authors provided a good rebuttal, and taking into accounting the initial positive reviews, I recommend the acceptance of the paper. After you have reviewed the rebuttal, please provide your final rating based on all reviews and the authors’ rebuttal. Accept What is the rank of this paper among all your rebuttal papers? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 5 Meta-Review #3 Please provide your assessment of the paper taking all information into account, including rebuttal. Highlight the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper, clarify how you reconciled contrasting review comments and scores, indicate if concerns were successfully addressed in the rebuttal, and provide a clear justification of your decision. If you disagree with some of the (meta)reviewer statements, you can indicate so in your meta-review. Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. The paper proposes a loss function for Faster R-CNN in the context of cell detection in histopathology images with incomplete annotations. The method obtains modest empirical improvements with respect to [7] on a public dataset of mitosis detection. Although the technical novelty of the proposed approach is limited, the rebuttal adequately argues the differences with the missing reference pointed out by R5, which should be discussed in the text. The empirical improvement is not large in absolute terms, but its statistical significance is assessed. Other reviewer comments should be included in the final version of the paper. After you have reviewed the rebuttal, please provide your final rating based on all reviews and the authors’ rebuttal. Accept What is the rank of this paper among all your rebuttal papers? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 5 Author Feedback Reviewer 5 (R5) suggests that PU learning has been applied to Faster RCNN in Yang et al., BMVC 2020 and thus the novelty of our work is limited. We would like to thank R5 for providing the reference. However, we respectfully disagree that the novelty of our work is limited. Yang et al., BMVC 2020 simply apply the PU learning strategy developed for classification to the detection problem without noticing the difference between object detection and image classification. In particular, as argued on page 5 (before Eq. 10) in our paper, in classification problems the distribution p(x) of an arbitrary sample is directly approximated using the distribution p(x_u) of unlabeled samples. But this approximation is problematic in object detection, because positively labeled and unlabeled samples originate from the same images. In this approximation, the positively labeled samples are excluded from the approximated distribution and the approximation is biased. We notice that the combination of positively labeled and unlabeled samples can approximate p(x) and revise the PU learning framework for the detection problem, which leads to the novel approximation in Eq. 10. This improvement is confirmed by experimental results (not reported in the current draft). Specifically, with the naive approximation used by Yang et al., BMVC 2020, the average precision is reduced from 0.530 to 0.503, which is much worse than the BDE result (0.516) and close to the baseline result (0.501), and this reduction is consistently observed for each fold; the average recall is 0.770, which is no better than the result achieved with our revised strategy. Therefore, although we have used a PU learning strategy, it is adapted to the detection problem with important contributions and novelty designs. We will include these results and clarify the novelty of our method. R3 suggests that the improvement from BDE to our method is small. We respectfully disagree. As shown in Table 2, on average our method has improved both precision and recall (ranging from 0 to 1) by more than 0.01. Such improvement is common in papers on object or cell detection (e.g., see AP50 in Table 7 in Kemal Oksuz et al., NeurIPS 2020, Table 3 in Xizhou Zhu et al., ICLR 2021, or Table 4 in Chao Li et al., MedIA 2018). Moreover, the improvement is statistically significant. Also, we believe that our method provides a promising direction for cell detection with incomplete annotations. Even with a relatively simple PU learning strategy, we have already achieved the improvement. Our method can motivate further improvements with more advanced PU learning methods in future work. Reviewer 1 (R1) suggests explaining the difference between our method and BDE. BDE treats samples in unlabeled areas as negative samples, but their weights are adjusted according to whether they are truly negative. Our method treats samples in unlabeled areas as unknown classes, and the classification term associated with negative samples are approximated with both positive samples and these unlabeled samples using a principled framework. We will better clarify this. R1 suggests that other detection networks and backbones should be considered. On a related note, Reviewer 3 (R3) suggests that other state-of-the-art works can be compared. We have actually tested different backbones for Faster RCNN, where VGG16, ResNet50, and ResNet101 were considered. For all cases, the proposed method outperforms the baseline method and BDE. Due to page limit, we only reported the results achieved with the VGG16 backbone, as it is associated with the best baseline performance. We will clarify that the results were achieved with VGG16, and the improvement can also be observed for other backbones. Note that our method is agnostic to the network structure. Thus, we expect that it can also be integrated with other detection networks, such as Cascade RCNN. Such integration can be explored in future work. Other minor issues will also be addressed. back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Cell detection in histopathology images is of great value in clinical practice. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to cell detection to improve the detection accuracy, where cell annotations are required for network training. However, due to the variety and large number of cells, complete annotations that include every cell of interest in the training images can be challenging. Usually, incomplete annotations can be achieved, where positive labeling results are carefully examined to ensure their reliability but there can be other positive instances, i.e., cells of interest, that are not included in the annotations. This annotation strategy leads to a lack of knowledge about true negative samples. Most existing methods simply treat instances that are not labeled as positive as truly negative during network training, which can adversely affect the network performance. In this work, to address the problem of incomplete annotations, we formulate the training of detection networks as a positive-unlabeled learning problem. Specifically, the classification loss in network training is revised to take into account incomplete annotations, where the terms corresponding to negative samples are approximated with the true positive samples and the other samples of which the labels are unknown. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were performed on a publicly available dataset for mitosis detection in breast cancer cells, and the experimental results show that our method improves the performance of cell detection given incomplete annotations for training.

      <p>The authors provided responses to some questions/comments raised by the reviewers. It would be better to describe the differences between the proposed PU-learning and a broad range of PU-learning related works to summarize the technical contributions beyond application domain contributions, rather than limiting the scope to one paper mentioned by the reviewer. 
The explanation about the significance of the small improvement (precision from 0.516 to 0.530, and recall from 0.759 to 0.771) did not convince the AC. 
Furthermore, in Table 1, the precision varies within [0.435, 0.567] and the recall varies within [0.670, 0.842], according to different folds. The small improvement is negligible, compared to the variance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reviewer 5 (R5) suggests that PU learning has been applied to Faster RCNN in Yang et al., BMVC 2020 and thus the novelty of our work is limited. We would like to thank R5 for providing the reference. However, we respectfully disagree that the novelty of our work is limited. Yang et al., BMVC 2020 simply apply the PU learning strategy developed for classification to the detection problem without noticing the difference between object detection and image classification. In particular, as argued on page 5 (before Eq. 10) in our paper, in classification problems the distribution p(x) of an arbitrary sample is directly approximated using the distribution p(x_u) of unlabeled samples. But this approximation is problematic in object detection, because positively labeled and unlabeled samples originate from the same images. In this approximation, the positively labeled samples are excluded from the approximated distribution and the approximation is biased. We notice that the combination of positively labeled and unlabeled samples can approximate p(x) and revise the PU learning framework for the detection problem, which leads to the novel approximation in Eq. 10. This improvement is confirmed by experimental results (not reported in the current draft). Specifically, with the naive approximation used by Yang et al., BMVC 2020, the average precision is reduced from 0.530 to 0.503, which is much worse than the BDE result (0.516) and close to the baseline result (0.501), and this reduction is consistently observed for each fold; the average recall is 0.770, which is no better than the result achieved with our revised strategy. Therefore, although we have used a PU learning strategy, it is adapted to the detection problem with important contributions and novelty designs. We will include these results and clarify the novelty of our method.</p>

  <p>R3 suggests that the improvement from BDE to our method is small. We respectfully disagree. As shown in Table 2, on average our method has improved both precision and recall (ranging from 0 to 1) by more than 0.01. Such improvement is common in papers on object or cell detection (e.g., see AP50 in Table 7 in Kemal Oksuz et al., NeurIPS 2020, Table 3 in Xizhou Zhu et al., ICLR 2021, or Table 4 in Chao Li et al., MedIA 2018). Moreover, the improvement is statistically significant. Also, we believe that our method provides a promising direction for cell detection with incomplete annotations. Even with a relatively simple PU learning strategy, we have already achieved the improvement. Our method can motivate further improvements with more advanced PU learning methods in future work.</p>

  <p>Reviewer 1 (R1) suggests explaining the difference between our method and BDE. BDE treats samples in unlabeled areas as negative samples, but their weights are adjusted according to whether they are truly negative. Our method treats samples in unlabeled areas as unknown classes, and the classification term associated with negative samples are approximated with both positive samples and these unlabeled samples using a principled framework. We will better clarify this.</p>

  <p>R1 suggests that other detection networks and backbones should be considered. On a related note, Reviewer 3 (R3) suggests that other state-of-the-art works can be compared. We have actually tested different backbones for Faster RCNN, where VGG16, ResNet50, and ResNet101 were considered. For all cases, the proposed method outperforms the baseline method and BDE. Due to page limit, we only reported the results achieved with the VGG16 backbone, as it is associated with the best baseline performance. We will clarify that the results were achieved with VGG16, and the improvement can also be observed for other backbones. Note that our method is agnostic to the network structure. Thus, we expect that it can also be integrated with other detection networks, such as Cascade RCNN. Such integration can be explored in future work.</p>

  <p>Other minor issues will also be addressed.</p>
