<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Xian Wu, Yangtian Yan, Shuang Zhao, Yehong Kuang, Shen Ge, Kai Wang, Xiang Chen Abstract Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease which occurs to 2%~3% of the world’s entire population. If treated properly, patients can still maintain a relatively high quality of life. Otherwise, Psoriasis could cause severe complications or even threat to life. Therefore, continuous tracking of severity degree is critical in Psoriasis treatment. However, due to the shortage of dermatologists, it’s hard for patients to receive regular severity evaluation. Furthermore, evaluating the severity degree of Psoriasis is both time-consuming and error-prone which poses a heavy burden for dermatologists. To address this problem, we propose an automatic rating model which measures the severity degree quantitatively based on skin lesion pictures. The proposed rating model applies coarse to fine grained neural net to evaluate skin lesion from multiple perspectives. According to experimental results, the proposed model outperforms experienced dermatologists.

They compared the results against dermatologists with different background, beating average dermatologists. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. This paper attempts an important clinical application that has been somewhat under explored before - assessing the severity level of Psoriasis disease using the PASI standard. The proposed method not only outputs an overall PASI score, but also subscores that describe different aspect of the severity. The dataset used in the paper is not huge, but the ground truth construction is very solid, based on consensus of three experienced dermatologists. The evaluation against humans is also well thought out, comparing against a large number of dermatologists with varying level of experience. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. This paper is more of an interesting ‘clinical’ paper, instead of a ‘methodology’ paper. The methodology is somewhat novel (i.e., introducing lesion attention module), but similar idea has been seen in other papers on skin lesion classification topic. It also lacks comparison against other automatic approaches, despite the large comparison against dermatologists. From the clinical perspective, it also lacks in-depth discussion to answer key clinical questions - e..g, why PASI is important in terms of severity monitoring, especially since many dermatologists don’t even use it, as reported in the paper? How big of the error will it matter? How reliable the ground truth is since inter-dermatologist agreement is high? Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The general architecture is reproducible since training/evaluation code is provided, but since no dataset nor pretrained models are provided, reproducibility is limited.

What is the ranking of this paper in your review stack? 2 Number of papers in your stack 5 Reviewer confidence Very confident Review #3 Please describe the contribution of the paper This paper introduces to automatically rank the severity of psoriasis disease. A Siamese network with attention module was used for comparison and ranking across different body regions. The experimental results with a private dataset appear to be reasonable. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The paper is well organized, which made audience easy to follow. There are detailed comparisons of the results derived from machines against clinicians. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. It seems that the proposed method is quite similar to the method mentioned in Reference 10, where both methods were applied to the same problem and used similar network architecture e.g., Siamese network. There are quite limited experiments on comparing to the existing deep learning based methods. It’s understandable that the proposed method is one of the first few methods applied for psoriasis disease. However, without comparison to the existing methods, it’s relatively difficult to understand that the Siamese network with attention module is the optimal solution to this problem. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The proposed method was developed with a self-organized dataset. The source codes were released, which made easier for reproducing the results. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html Authors should consider to explain the key differences to Reference 10. It’s relatively difficult to understand that there are sufficient differences to Reference 10. There is no comparison to the existing methods e.g., deep learning based methods for medical image classification. Therefore, it’s challenging to understand that the proposed method has improved the state-of-the-art.

Response to Reviewer 3: Q1: Comparison against other automatic approaches A1: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first piece of work that automatically predicts the PASI score as well as all the 16 sub-scores. There are few automatic baselines for this particular task. Therefore we mainly compare with experienced dermatologists. Nevertheless, we conduct ablation studies in Table 2 to prove the effectiveness of two proposed modules. Q2: Emphasize its clinical impact. A2: PASI is the most frequently adopted indicator which helps in Psoriasis diagnosis and proper therapy selection. As shown in the first column of Table 1, with the increase of the hospital level, the adoption rate of PASI is increasing, which shows from one perspective that the PASI is helpful in clinics. In the questionnaire to 223 dermatologists, we also ask what’s the major drawbacks of PASI in practise. 87% choose complicated to calculate, subjective and inconsistent. In this paper, we learn from the consensus of three dermatologists who have 10 years’ PASI scoring experiences, and target to produce objective and consistent PASI scores in milli-seconds. The proposed model is proven to be comparable to experienced dematologists. This might help to increase the PASI adoption rate especially in community and county level hospitals and improve the Psoriasis treatment quality. Response to Reviewer 4: Q1: Other technical baselines A1: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first piece of work that automatically predicts the PASI score as well as all the 16 sub-scores. There are few automatic baselines for this particular task. Therefore we mainly compare with experienced dermatologists. Nevertheless, we conduct ablation studies in Table 2 to prove the effectiveness of two proposed modules. Q2: More dermatology AI papers A2: We will cite more dermatology AI papers including both Psoriasis and other skin diseases. Response to Reviewer 5: Q1: Relation to the published work [10]. A1: [10] targets to give a local severity score of a single skin lesion image which differs from our work in the following perspectives: (1) [10] only outputs a single score to denote the severity which is hard to interpret. While ours outputs all the 16 sub-scores of PASI including of erythema, induration, desquamation and area ratio for four body parts; (2) [10] only accepts single image input, but the PASI score needs to consider all skin lesions of four body parts. Our model follows the excat PASI calculating procedure and accepts multiple input images for all four body parts; 3) [10] didn’t conduct a comparison with dermatologists to prove its effectiveness in clinics. Q2: Compare to deep learning based methods for medical image classification. A2: We compare with a state-of-the-art model [1] recently proposed in MICCAI 2020 for pulmonary edema severity assessment of chest radiography images. We adopt their major model, but remove the textual part since we do not have any reports. Under comparable settings, the MAE results on four aspects: Erythema, Induration, Desquamation and Area Ratio are 0.495, 0.545, 0.555 and 1.11, which is larger (worse) than 0.463, 0.481, 0.487 and 0.634 of our proposed model equipped with the LAM module and the siamese network. These results confirms the effectiveness of our introduced model. [1] Chauhan, Geeticka, et al. Joint Modeling of Chest Radiographs and Radiology Reports for Pulmonary Edema Assessment.

If treated properly, patients can still maintain a relatively high quality of life. Otherwise, Psoriasis could cause severe complications or even threat to life. Therefore, continuous tracking of severity degree is critical in Psoriasis treatment. However, due to the shortage of dermatologists, it’s hard for patients to receive regular severity evaluation. Furthermore, evaluating the severity degree of Psoriasis is both time-consuming and error-prone which poses a heavy burden for dermatologists. To address this problem, we propose an automatic rating model which measures the severity degree quantitatively based on skin lesion pictures. The proposed rating model applies coarse to fine grained neural net to evaluate skin lesion from multiple perspectives. According to experimental results, the proposed model outperforms experienced dermatologists.

They compared the results against dermatologists with different background, beating average dermatologists. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. This paper attempts an important clinical application that has been somewhat under explored before - assessing the severity level of Psoriasis disease using the PASI standard. The proposed method not only outputs an overall PASI score, but also subscores that describe different aspect of the severity. The dataset used in the paper is not huge, but the ground truth construction is very solid, based on consensus of three experienced dermatologists. The evaluation against humans is also well thought out, comparing against a large number of dermatologists with varying level of experience. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. This paper is more of an interesting ‘clinical’ paper, instead of a ‘methodology’ paper. The methodology is somewhat novel (i.e., introducing lesion attention module), but similar idea has been seen in other papers on skin lesion classification topic. It also lacks comparison against other automatic approaches, despite the large comparison against dermatologists. From the clinical perspective, it also lacks in-depth discussion to answer key clinical questions - e..g, why PASI is important in terms of severity monitoring, especially since many dermatologists don’t even use it, as reported in the paper? How big of the error will it matter? How reliable the ground truth is since inter-dermatologist agreement is high? Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The general architecture is reproducible since training/evaluation code is provided, but since no dataset nor pretrained models are provided, reproducibility is limited.

A Siamese network with attention module was used for comparison and ranking across different body regions. The experimental results with a private dataset appear to be reasonable. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The paper is well organized, which made audience easy to follow. There are detailed comparisons of the results derived from machines against clinicians. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. It seems that the proposed method is quite similar to the method mentioned in Reference 10, where both methods were applied to the same problem and used similar network architecture e.g., Siamese network. There are quite limited experiments on comparing to the existing deep learning based methods. It’s understandable that the proposed method is one of the first few methods applied for psoriasis disease. However, without comparison to the existing methods, it’s relatively difficult to understand that the Siamese network with attention module is the optimal solution to this problem. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The proposed method was developed with a self-organized dataset. The source codes were released, which made easier for reproducing the results. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html Authors should consider to explain the key differences to Reference 10. It’s relatively difficult to understand that there are sufficient differences to Reference 10. There is no comparison to the existing methods e.g., deep learning based methods for medical image classification. Therefore, it’s challenging to understand that the proposed method has improved the state-of-the-art.

Response to Reviewer 3: Q1: Comparison against other automatic approaches A1: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first piece of work that automatically predicts the PASI score as well as all the 16 sub-scores. There are few automatic baselines for this particular task. Therefore we mainly compare with experienced dermatologists. Nevertheless, we conduct ablation studies in Table 2 to prove the effectiveness of two proposed modules. Q2: Emphasize its clinical impact. A2: PASI is the most frequently adopted indicator which helps in Psoriasis diagnosis and proper therapy selection. As shown in the first column of Table 1, with the increase of the hospital level, the adoption rate of PASI is increasing, which shows from one perspective that the PASI is helpful in clinics. In the questionnaire to 223 dermatologists, we also ask what’s the major drawbacks of PASI in practise. 87% choose complicated to calculate, subjective and inconsistent. In this paper, we learn from the consensus of three dermatologists who have 10 years’ PASI scoring experiences, and target to produce objective and consistent PASI scores in milli-seconds. The proposed model is proven to be comparable to experienced dematologists. This might help to increase the PASI adoption rate especially in community and county level hospitals and improve the Psoriasis treatment quality. Response to Reviewer 4: Q1: Other technical baselines A1: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first piece of work that automatically predicts the PASI score as well as all the 16 sub-scores. There are few automatic baselines for this particular task. Therefore we mainly compare with experienced dermatologists. Nevertheless, we conduct ablation studies in Table 2 to prove the effectiveness of two proposed modules. Q2: More dermatology AI papers A2: We will cite more dermatology AI papers including both Psoriasis and other skin diseases. Response to Reviewer 5: Q1: Relation to the published work [10]. A1: [10] targets to give a local severity score of a single skin lesion image which differs from our work in the following perspectives: (1) [10] only outputs a single score to denote the severity which is hard to interpret. While ours outputs all the 16 sub-scores of PASI including of erythema, induration, desquamation and area ratio for four body parts; (2) [10] only accepts single image input, but the PASI score needs to consider all skin lesions of four body parts. Our model follows the excat PASI calculating procedure and accepts multiple input images for all four body parts; 3) [10] didn’t conduct a comparison with dermatologists to prove its effectiveness in clinics. Q2: Compare to deep learning based methods for medical image classification. A2: We compare with a state-of-the-art model [1] recently proposed in MICCAI 2020 for pulmonary edema severity assessment of chest radiography images. We adopt their major model, but remove the textual part since we do not have any reports. Under comparable settings, the MAE results on four aspects: Erythema, Induration, Desquamation and Area Ratio are 0.495, 0.545, 0.555 and 1.11, which is larger (worse) than 0.463, 0.481, 0.487 and 0.634 of our proposed model equipped with the LAM module and the siamese network. These results confirms the effectiveness of our introduced model. [1] Chauhan, Geeticka, et al. Joint Modeling of Chest Radiographs and Radiology Reports for Pulmonary Edema Assessment.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease which occurs to 2%~3% of the world’s entire population. If treated properly, patients can still maintain a relatively high quality of life. Otherwise, Psoriasis could cause severe complications or even threat to life. Therefore, continuous tracking of severity degree is critical in Psoriasis treatment. However, due to the shortage of dermatologists, it’s hard for patients to receive regular severity evaluation. Furthermore, evaluating the severity degree of Psoriasis is both time-consuming and error-prone which poses a heavy burden for dermatologists. To address this problem, we propose an automatic rating model which measures the severity degree quantitatively based on skin lesion pictures. The proposed rating model applies coarse to fine grained neural net to evaluate skin lesion from multiple perspectives. According to experimental results, the proposed model outperforms experienced dermatologists.

    <blockquote>
      <p>This paper is more of an interesting ‘clinical’ paper, instead of a ‘methodology’ paper. The methodology is somewhat novel (i.e., introducing lesion attention module), but similar idea has been seen in other papers on skin lesion classification topic. It also lacks comparison against other automatic approaches, despite the large comparison against dermatologists. From the clinical perspective, it also lacks in-depth discussion to answer key clinical questions - e..g, why PASI is important in terms of severity monitoring, especially since many dermatologists don’t even use it, as reported in the paper?  How big of the error will it matter? How reliable the ground truth is since inter-dermatologist agreement is high?</p>

      <p>It seems that the proposed method is quite similar to the method mentioned in Reference 10, where both methods were applied to the same problem and used similar network architecture e.g., Siamese network.</p>

      <p>There are quite limited experiments on comparing to the existing deep learning based methods. It’s understandable that the proposed method is one of the first few methods applied for psoriasis disease.

  <p>We thank all reviewers for their helpful comments.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Response to Reviewer 3:</p>

  <p>Q1: Comparison against other automatic approaches</p>

  <p>A1: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first piece of work that automatically predicts the PASI score as well as all the 16 sub-scores. There are few automatic baselines for this particular task. Therefore we mainly compare with experienced dermatologists. Nevertheless, we conduct ablation studies in Table 2 to prove the effectiveness of two proposed modules.</p>

  <p>Q2: Emphasize its clinical impact.</p>

  <p>A2: PASI is the most frequently adopted indicator which helps in Psoriasis diagnosis and proper therapy selection. As shown in the first column of Table 1, with the increase of the hospital level, the adoption rate of PASI is increasing, which shows from one perspective that the PASI is helpful in clinics. In the questionnaire to 223 dermatologists, we also ask what’s the major drawbacks of PASI in practise. 87% choose complicated to calculate, subjective and inconsistent. In this paper, we learn from the consensus of three dermatologists who have 10 years’ PASI scoring experiences, and target to produce objective and consistent PASI scores in milli-seconds. The proposed model is proven to be comparable to experienced dematologists. This might help to increase the PASI adoption rate especially in community and county level hospitals and improve the Psoriasis treatment quality.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Response to Reviewer 4:</p>

  <p>Q1: Other technical baselines</p>

  <p>A1: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first piece of work that automatically predicts the PASI score as well as all the 16 sub-scores. There are few automatic baselines for this particular task. Therefore we mainly compare with experienced dermatologists. Nevertheless, we conduct ablation studies in Table 2 to prove the effectiveness of two proposed modules.</p>

  <p>Q2: More dermatology AI papers</p>

  <p>A2: We will cite more dermatology AI papers including both Psoriasis and other skin diseases.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Response to Reviewer 5:</p>

  <p>Q1: Relation to the published work [10].</p>

  <p>A1: [10] targets to give a local severity score of a single skin lesion image which differs from our work in the following perspectives: (1) [10] only outputs a single score to denote the severity which is hard to interpret. While ours outputs all the 16 sub-scores of PASI including of erythema, induration, desquamation and area ratio for four body parts; (2) [10] only accepts single image input, but the PASI score needs to consider all skin lesions of four body parts. Our model follows the excat PASI calculating procedure and accepts multiple input images for all four body parts; 3) [10] didn’t conduct a comparison with dermatologists to prove its effectiveness in clinics.</p>

  <p>Q2: Compare to deep learning based methods for medical image classification.</p>

  <p>A2: We compare with a state-of-the-art model [1] recently proposed in MICCAI 2020 for pulmonary edema severity assessment of chest radiography images. We adopt their major model, but remove the textual part since we do not have any reports. Under comparable settings, the MAE results on four aspects: Erythema, Induration, Desquamation and Area Ratio are 0.495, 0.545, 0.555 and 1.11, which is larger (worse) than 0.463, 0.481, 0.487 and 0.634 of our proposed model equipped with the LAM module and the siamese network. These results confirms the effectiveness of our introduced model.</p>
