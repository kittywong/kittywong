<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Wenhui Lei, Wei Xu, Ran Gu, Hao Fu, Shaoting Zhang, Shichuan Zhang, Guotai Wang Abstract Deep learning networks have shown promising performance for object localization in medial images, but require large amount of annotated data for supervised training. To address this problem, we propose: 1) A novel contrastive learning method which embeds the anatomical structure by predicting the Relative Position Regression (RPR) between any two patches from the same volume; 2) An one-shot framework for organ and landmark localization in volumetric medical images. Our main idea comes from that tissues and organs from different human bodies own similar relative position and context. Therefore, we could predict the relative positions of their non-local patches, thus locate the target organ. Our one-shot localization framework is composed of three parts: 1) A deep network trained to project the input patch into a 3D latent vector, representing its anatomical position; 2) A coarse-to-fine framework contains two projection networks, providing more accurate localization of the target; 3) Based on the coarse-to-fine model, we transfer the organ bounding-box (B-box) detection to locating six extreme points along x, y and z directions in the query volume. Experiments on multi-organ localization from head-and-neck (HaN) and abdominal CT volumes showed that our method acquired competitive performance in real time, which is more accurate and 10^5 times faster than template matching methods with the same setting for one-shot localization in 3D medical images.

The method is based on relative position regression in a contrastive learning strategy. It can learn a projection network that predicts the relative offset of two image patches. During inference, a support image can help to locate the desired position in the testing image. The method is validated on a head and neck CT dataset and a pancreas CT dataset.

Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The proposed method is novel and does not require ground truth during training and thus scalable easily. The experimental results show significantly better performance than other one-shot detection settings and comparable to a state-of-the-art supervised localization method. The paper is well presented. The results are promising with significant speedup. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. More discussions about the assumptions and limitations of the proposed method should be added. I think the method assumes that the training and the testing volumes in the same population with the same or similar properties, like body size and orientation. Perhaps, this is the reason that the results of the pancreas are much worse than brain structures, especially compared with the Retina U-Net, considering larger variability of abdominal organs? Some experimental details are missing. Is the validation set only used during inference? Is it used in training to select a model? During training, are the query and support patches sampled under uniform distribution across the entire image volume? How many pairs are sampled in each epoch?

The best value can be found by setting different rc and rf comparative experiments. This can enrich the experiment and make the parameter settings more convincing. Please state your overall opinion of the paper accept (8) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? novelty is sufficient What is the ranking of this paper in your review stack? 1 Number of papers in your stack 5 Reviewer confidence Somewhat confident Review #3 Please describe the contribution of the paper The paper aims to propose a new method for object localization in 3D medical images. The method is based on relative position regression in a contrastive learning strategy. It can learn a projection network that predicts the relative offset of two image patches. During inference, a support image can help to locate the desired position in the testing image. The method is validated on a head and neck CT dataset and a pancreas CT dataset. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The proposed method is novel and does not require ground truth during training and thus scalable easily. The experimental results show significantly better performance than other one-shot detection settings and comparable to a state-of-the-art supervised localization method. The paper is well presented. The results are promising with significant speedup. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. More discussions about the assumptions and limitations of the proposed method should be added. I think the method assumes that the training and the testing volumes in the same population with the same or similar properties, like body size and orientation. Perhaps, this is the reason that the results of the pancreas are much worse than brain structures, especially compared with the Retina U-Net, considering larger variability of abdominal organs? Some experimental details are missing. Is the validation set only used during inference? Is it used in training to select a model? During training, are the query and support patches sampled under uniform distribution across the entire image volume? How many pairs are sampled in each epoch? Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The method is described clearly and not very complicated. It should be easy to reproduce. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html It would be very interesting to see more results for organs or structures with large variant in shapes and pathologies in the future work. Some sentences need to be improved or corrected. For example, I don’t understand this sentence in the Experiments section (which maybe incomplete?): “Despite FM Cosine slightly outperformed our method in terms of IoU of the right parotids, its performance is much lower on the brain stem, and need to list the scores.” Please state your overall opinion of the paper accept (8) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? The method is novel, fast, and scalable. But there are some missing details and assumptions.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Deep learning networks have shown promising performance for object localization in medial images, but require large amount of annotated data for supervised training. To address this problem, we propose: 1) A novel contrastive learning method which embeds the anatomical structure by predicting the Relative Position Regression (RPR) between any two patches from the same volume; 2) An one-shot framework for organ and landmark localization in volumetric medical images. Our main idea comes from that tissues and organs from different human bodies own similar relative position and context. Therefore, we could predict the relative positions of their non-local patches, thus locate the target organ. Our one-shot localization framework is composed of three parts: 1) A deep network trained to project the input patch into a 3D latent vector, representing its anatomical position; 2) A coarse-to-fine framework contains two projection networks, providing more accurate localization of the target; 3) Based on the coarse-to-fine model, we transfer the organ bounding-box (B-box) detection to locating six extreme points along x, y and z directions in the query volume. Experiments on multi-organ localization from head-and-neck (HaN) and abdominal CT volumes showed that our method acquired competitive performance in real time, which is more accurate and 10^5 times faster than template matching methods with the same setting for one-shot localization in 3D medical images.

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>The description of the performance of the experimental results in the abstract and the introduction is the same. “Experiments on multi-organ localization from head-and-neck (HaN) and abdominal CT volumes showed that our method acquired competitive performance in real time.”</li>
        <li>The word “agent” is mentioned many times in the article. Although I can roughly understand its meaning, can you specify what it means?</li>
        <li>The evaluation metrics in this article are only briefly mentioned, can you specify them through formulas? Also, using only two evaluation metrics may not be so convincing.</li>
        <li>In the experiment of “Performance of organ localization and multi-run ensemble”, the number of MREs for the “Diagonal” strategy is only 1, and the number of MREs for the “Extreme” strategy is 1 to 20. The number of MREs for the “Diagonal” strategy should also be 1 to 20. This is not very rigorous.</li>
        <li>In the supplementary figure 1, the height of the graphics with N=32, N=64, and N=128 is not vivid and beautiful, and the height can be adjusted appropriately according to the numerical value. Also, try not to show specific formulas in the figure. You can use images and symbols to indicate.</li>
        <li>In Figure 2, the color of the box can be briefly explained in the corners of the figure. The content in the box can only be represented by symbols, and the image can be more varied and more complicated.
7.. In Figure 4, the effect of the prediction result compared with the ground truth can be seen, but it is not intuitive enough. The corresponding IoU should be noted on the graph. The combination of number and shape is more intuitive.</li>
        <li>In this paper, there is no need to have an explanation for every symbol that does not appear once. You can make a table at the beginning of the second chapter to sort out the meaning of all symbols.</li>
        <li>In this paper, the coarse and fine model Mc, Mf are trained separately. You set rc= 300, rf= 30 for HaN and rc= 700, rf= 50 for pancreas. This paper did not choose rc, rf through experiments. The best value can be found by setting different rc and rf comparative experiments. This can enrich the experiment and make the parameter settings more convincing.</li>

      <p>It would be very interesting to see more results for organs or structures with large variant in shapes and pathologies in the future work.</p>

      <p>Some sentences need to be improved or corrected. For example, I don’t understand this sentence in the Experiments section (which maybe incomplete?): “Despite FM Cosine slightly outperformed our method in terms of IoU of the right parotids, its performance is much lower on the brain stem, and need to list the scores.”</p>
