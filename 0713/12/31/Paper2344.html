<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Mickael Tardy, Diana Mateus Abstract Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging imaging technique for breast cancer screening aiming to overcome certain limitations of traditional mammography, such as the superimposition of tissues. On the downside, DBT increases the radiologists’ workload as it generates stacks of high-resolution images, which are time-consuming to review and annotate. In this work, we propose a deep- multiple-instance-based method for DBT volume classification that relies on the local summarization of DBT slices (referred to as slabbing) and only requires volume-wise labels for training. Slabbing offers several advantages: i) it reduces the classifier’s computational complexity across the depth, letting it focus on the higher transversal resolution. Thanks to this strategy, we are the first to train a method at almost full-resolution (as high as 120x2500x2000); ii) it produces slabs that are closer to standard mammography, favoring an efficient transfer from classifiers trained on larger mammography databases; and iii) the slabs combined with a Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) classifier result in localized information favoring interpretability. The proposed slabbing MIL approach is also novel for the automatic classification of DBTs. Moreover, we propose a trainable alternative to the handcrafted slabbing algorithms based on slice-wise attention that improves performance. We perform an experimental validation on a subset of the public BCS-DBT dataset and achieve an AUC of 0.73 with five-fold cross-validation. On a private multi-vendor dataset we obtain a similar AUC of 0.73, demonstrating an excellent performance consistency.

If you disagree with some of the (meta)reviewer statements, you can indicate so in your meta-review. Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. DBT diagnosis is a very timely topic, and a challenging one due to large volume sizes. Instead of max-pooling individual slices (MIL), the paper proposes to group them in “slabs”, so-called summarization, before combining for a decision. Echoing the reviewers’ assessments, the contribution value of this is relatively incremental. Original comparison with a baseline of MIL from the conference paper [23] (and adding [7] in rebuttal) are also not too convincing. These baselines are motivated as the only classification-based ones in DBT, although methodologically a similar restriction of learning from image-level labels occur in a wide range of medical applications, from histopathology to MR&amp;CT based radiology reports. Whether the presented 60-70% AUC is clinically acceptable is also another question. On a problem motivation level, in DBT just a diagnostic decision (volume classification) alone is probably less practical, as any method would need to be able to reason a decision to the radiologist, e.g. showing the mass or micro-calcifications for a positive result, therefore the clinical applicability of the given method as-is is also doubtful. So, I would not champion the acceptance of this work myself, but given the timeliness of DBT, I would not be against its acceptance either.

We agree that two major strengths are the clinical relevance associated with the new Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) modality and the evaluation on two independent (a public and a private) datasets. A third strength is the computational advantage of our method, which allows handling high-resolution (60x2500x2000) DBT volumes. The major weakness identified by the three reviewers is the presumable lack of comparison to state-of-the-art (SOA) methods. We believe this remark was due to a lack of clarity in the description of our experiments. The comparison to a SOA method is already part of the experiments presented in Table 1, where the line called “MIL” corresponds to the method in reference [23] with a small adaption. We chose [23] as it is one of the most recent (2019) DBT classification methods relying on volume-wise labels. Our adaption favors transfer learning from mammography (i.e., instead of training a classifier from scratch) and allows the processing of full-size DBT slices (instead of 1024x1024 in [23]). We will clarify that the MIL approach refers to this adaption of [23]. Furthermore, we could add the AUC metrics of the original implementation of [23] without the adaption: “Method &amp; Transfer learning &amp; Fully trainable &amp; Partially trainable &amp; Not trained” “MIL ([23] adapted) &amp; 63.80±9.74 &amp; 67.03±6.72 &amp; 64.30±8.62” “[23] &amp; NA &amp; NA &amp; 62.27$±$10.62 &amp; NA”. where NA indicates the training strategy is not relevant. Another, more recent (2020), SOA classification method Doganay et al [7], rescales images to 256x256. As discussed on page 2 (see “However, recent…”) such scale prevents capturing smaller findings. We have studied the effect of downsampling in Section 3 and Fig. 3, showing that lower resolutions result in worse performance. Moreover, the method of [7] requires annotations at the slice level. These reasons justified our initial choice to not directly compare against [7]. If considered relevant, we can add this comparison to [7] to the experiences in Table 1 as follows “Doganay et al. &amp; NA &amp; 60.47$\pm$8.15 &amp; NA &amp; NA“. We see that on our dataset both SOA methods, [23] without adaption and [7], are outperformed by [23] with adaption and by the proposed method. The quality of the slabs produced by our method vs. MIP or SoftMIP (R1, R4) was evaluated indirectly through the classification task (see Table 1) since no direct quantitative metrics exist [6]. Moreover, we note in Fig. 3 that the performance decreases with thicker slabs, validating the interest of multiple thinner slabs, compared to unique volume-wise MIP or SoftMIP projections. Regarding the slab thickness (R1 and R4), we draw attention to Fig. 4 and to the “Slab thickness study” paragraph in section 3, where the performance for different thicknesses was reported. R1 suggests we set T also according to the slice spacing, this is what we do as stated in the “Hyper-parameters” paragraph. Regarding the R5’s question, 3D deep learning techniques could not be directly applied to full-resolution DBT images due to hardware limitations. That is, a full DBT volume has a size of approx. 60x2500x2000, which can not be fitted for training in modern GPU hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Tesla V100 or RTX 2080 ti). Concerning the access to data (R4 and R5), we note that the BCS dataset [3] is public. As for PMV datasets, they can be shared upon justified requests and right-holder approvals. We will mention it in the dataset paragraph of section 3. Concerning the bounding box cropping (R1), it is a common preprocessing technique consisting of removing empty background columns and rows of an image. For clarity, we will add a statement in the “Data Preparation” (sec 3) and revise Fig 1. Finally, we observed no overfitting (R1) in our experiments. To prevent it we used data augmentation described in “Data preparation” and we rely on transfer learning from a bigger mammography dataset (i.e., 2000 images). back to top" />

We see that on our dataset both SOA methods, [23] without adaption and [7], are outperformed by [23] with adaption and by the proposed method. The quality of the slabs produced by our method vs. MIP or SoftMIP (R1, R4) was evaluated indirectly through the classification task (see Table 1) since no direct quantitative metrics exist [6]. Moreover, we note in Fig. 3 that the performance decreases with thicker slabs, validating the interest of multiple thinner slabs, compared to unique volume-wise MIP or SoftMIP projections. Regarding the slab thickness (R1 and R4), we draw attention to Fig. 4 and to the “Slab thickness study” paragraph in section 3, where the performance for different thicknesses was reported. R1 suggests we set T also according to the slice spacing, this is what we do as stated in the “Hyper-parameters” paragraph. Regarding the R5’s question, 3D deep learning techniques could not be directly applied to full-resolution DBT images due to hardware limitations. That is, a full DBT volume has a size of approx. 60x2500x2000, which can not be fitted for training in modern GPU hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Tesla V100 or RTX 2080 ti). Concerning the access to data (R4 and R5), we note that the BCS dataset [3] is public. As for PMV datasets, they can be shared upon justified requests and right-holder approvals. We will mention it in the dataset paragraph of section 3. Concerning the bounding box cropping (R1), it is a common preprocessing technique consisting of removing empty background columns and rows of an image. For clarity, we will add a statement in the “Data Preparation” (sec 3) and revise Fig 1. Finally, we observed no overfitting (R1) in our experiments. To prevent it we used data augmentation described in “Data preparation” and we rely on transfer learning from a bigger mammography dataset (i.e., 2000 images). back to top" />

On the downside, DBT increases the radiologists’ workload as it generates stacks of high-resolution images, which are time-consuming to review and annotate. In this work, we propose a deep- multiple-instance-based method for DBT volume classification that relies on the local summarization of DBT slices (referred to as slabbing) and only requires volume-wise labels for training. Slabbing offers several advantages: i) it reduces the classifier’s computational complexity across the depth, letting it focus on the higher transversal resolution. Thanks to this strategy, we are the first to train a method at almost full-resolution (as high as 120x2500x2000); ii) it produces slabs that are closer to standard mammography, favoring an efficient transfer from classifiers trained on larger mammography databases; and iii) the slabs combined with a Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) classifier result in localized information favoring interpretability. The proposed slabbing MIL approach is also novel for the automatic classification of DBTs. Moreover, we propose a trainable alternative to the handcrafted slabbing algorithms based on slice-wise attention that improves performance. We perform an experimental validation on a subset of the public BCS-DBT dataset and achieve an AUC of 0.73 with five-fold cross-validation. On a private multi-vendor dataset we obtain a similar AUC of 0.73, demonstrating an excellent performance consistency.

If you disagree with some of the (meta)reviewer statements, you can indicate so in your meta-review. Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. DBT diagnosis is a very timely topic, and a challenging one due to large volume sizes. Instead of max-pooling individual slices (MIL), the paper proposes to group them in “slabs”, so-called summarization, before combining for a decision. Echoing the reviewers’ assessments, the contribution value of this is relatively incremental. Original comparison with a baseline of MIL from the conference paper [23] (and adding [7] in rebuttal) are also not too convincing. These baselines are motivated as the only classification-based ones in DBT, although methodologically a similar restriction of learning from image-level labels occur in a wide range of medical applications, from histopathology to MR&amp;CT based radiology reports. Whether the presented 60-70% AUC is clinically acceptable is also another question. On a problem motivation level, in DBT just a diagnostic decision (volume classification) alone is probably less practical, as any method would need to be able to reason a decision to the radiologist, e.g. showing the mass or micro-calcifications for a positive result, therefore the clinical applicability of the given method as-is is also doubtful. So, I would not champion the acceptance of this work myself, but given the timeliness of DBT, I would not be against its acceptance either.

We agree that two major strengths are the clinical relevance associated with the new Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) modality and the evaluation on two independent (a public and a private) datasets. A third strength is the computational advantage of our method, which allows handling high-resolution (60x2500x2000) DBT volumes. The major weakness identified by the three reviewers is the presumable lack of comparison to state-of-the-art (SOA) methods. We believe this remark was due to a lack of clarity in the description of our experiments. The comparison to a SOA method is already part of the experiments presented in Table 1, where the line called “MIL” corresponds to the method in reference [23] with a small adaption. We chose [23] as it is one of the most recent (2019) DBT classification methods relying on volume-wise labels. Our adaption favors transfer learning from mammography (i.e., instead of training a classifier from scratch) and allows the processing of full-size DBT slices (instead of 1024x1024 in [23]). We will clarify that the MIL approach refers to this adaption of [23]. Furthermore, we could add the AUC metrics of the original implementation of [23] without the adaption: “Method &amp; Transfer learning &amp; Fully trainable &amp; Partially trainable &amp; Not trained” “MIL ([23] adapted) &amp; 63.80±9.74 &amp; 67.03±6.72 &amp; 64.30±8.62” “[23] &amp; NA &amp; NA &amp; 62.27$±$10.62 &amp; NA”. where NA indicates the training strategy is not relevant. Another, more recent (2020), SOA classification method Doganay et al [7], rescales images to 256x256. As discussed on page 2 (see “However, recent…”) such scale prevents capturing smaller findings. We have studied the effect of downsampling in Section 3 and Fig. 3, showing that lower resolutions result in worse performance. Moreover, the method of [7] requires annotations at the slice level. These reasons justified our initial choice to not directly compare against [7]. If considered relevant, we can add this comparison to [7] to the experiences in Table 1 as follows “Doganay et al. &amp; NA &amp; 60.47$\\pm$8.15 &amp; NA &amp; NA“. We see that on our dataset both SOA methods, [23] without adaption and [7], are outperformed by [23] with adaption and by the proposed method. The quality of the slabs produced by our method vs. MIP or SoftMIP (R1, R4) was evaluated indirectly through the classification task (see Table 1) since no direct quantitative metrics exist [6]. Moreover, we note in Fig. 3 that the performance decreases with thicker slabs, validating the interest of multiple thinner slabs, compared to unique volume-wise MIP or SoftMIP projections. Regarding the slab thickness (R1 and R4), we draw attention to Fig. 4 and to the “Slab thickness study” paragraph in section 3, where the performance for different thicknesses was reported. R1 suggests we set T also according to the slice spacing, this is what we do as stated in the “Hyper-parameters” paragraph. Regarding the R5’s question, 3D deep learning techniques could not be directly applied to full-resolution DBT images due to hardware limitations. That is, a full DBT volume has a size of approx. 60x2500x2000, which can not be fitted for training in modern GPU hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Tesla V100 or RTX 2080 ti). Concerning the access to data (R4 and R5), we note that the BCS dataset [3] is public. As for PMV datasets, they can be shared upon justified requests and right-holder approvals. We will mention it in the dataset paragraph of section 3. Concerning the bounding box cropping (R1), it is a common preprocessing technique consisting of removing empty background columns and rows of an image. For clarity, we will add a statement in the “Data Preparation” (sec 3) and revise Fig 1. Finally, we observed no overfitting (R1) in our experiments. To prevent it we used data augmentation described in “Data preparation” and we rely on transfer learning from a bigger mammography dataset (i.e., 2000 images). back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging imaging technique for breast cancer screening aiming to overcome certain limitations of traditional mammography, such as the superimposition of tissues. On the downside, DBT increases the radiologists’ workload as it generates stacks of high-resolution images, which are time-consuming to review and annotate. In this work, we propose a deep- multiple-instance-based method for DBT volume classification that relies on the local summarization of DBT slices (referred to as slabbing) and only requires volume-wise labels for training. Slabbing offers several advantages: i) it reduces the classifier’s computational complexity across the depth, letting it focus on the higher transversal resolution. Thanks to this strategy, we are the first to train a method at almost full-resolution (as high as 120x2500x2000); ii) it produces slabs that are closer to standard mammography, favoring an efficient transfer from classifiers trained on larger mammography databases; and iii) the slabs combined with a Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) classifier result in localized information favoring interpretability. The proposed slabbing MIL approach is also novel for the automatic classification of DBTs. Moreover, we propose a trainable alternative to the handcrafted slabbing algorithms based on slice-wise attention that improves performance. We perform an experimental validation on a subset of the public BCS-DBT dataset and achieve an AUC of 0.73 with five-fold cross-validation. On a private multi-vendor dataset we obtain a similar AUC of 0.73, demonstrating an excellent performance consistency.

    <blockquote>
      <p>DBT diagnosis is a very timely topic, and a challenging one due to large volume sizes. Instead of max-pooling individual slices (MIL), the paper proposes to group them in “slabs”, so-called summarization, before combining for a decision.  Echoing the reviewers’ assessments, the contribution value of this is relatively incremental.</p>

      <p>Original comparison with a baseline of MIL from the conference paper [23] (and adding [7] in rebuttal) are also not too convincing. These baselines are motivated as the only classification-based ones in DBT, although methodologically a similar restriction of learning from image-level labels occur in a wide range of medical applications, from histopathology to MR&amp;CT based radiology reports. Whether the presented 60-70% AUC is clinically acceptable is also another question.</p>

      <p>On a problem motivation level, in DBT just a diagnostic decision (volume classification) alone is probably less practical, as any method would need to be able to reason a decision to the radiologist, e.g. showing the mass or micro-calcifications for a positive result, therefore the clinical applicability of the given method as-is is also doubtful.</p>

      <p>So, I would not champion the acceptance of this work myself, but given the timeliness of DBT, I would not be against its acceptance either.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We thank the reviewers and AC for their comments. We agree that two major strengths are the clinical relevance associated with the new Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) modality and the evaluation on two independent (a public and a private) datasets. A third strength is the computational advantage of our method, which allows handling high-resolution (60x2500x2000) DBT volumes.</p>

  <p>The major weakness identified by the three reviewers is the presumable lack of comparison to state-of-the-art (SOA) methods. We believe this remark was due to a lack of clarity in the description of our experiments. The comparison to a SOA method is already part of the experiments presented in Table 1, where the line called “MIL” corresponds to the method in reference [23] with a small adaption. We chose [23] as it is one of the most recent (2019) DBT classification methods relying on volume-wise labels. Our adaption favors transfer learning from mammography (i.e., instead of training a classifier from scratch) and allows the processing of full-size DBT slices (instead of 1024x1024 in [23]). We will clarify that the MIL approach refers to this adaption of [23]. Furthermore, we could add the AUC metrics of the original implementation of [23] without the adaption: 
“Method &amp; Transfer learning &amp; Fully trainable &amp; Partially trainable &amp; Not trained”
“MIL ([23] adapted) &amp; 63.80±9.74 &amp; 67.03±6.72 &amp; 64.30±8.62”
“[23] &amp; NA &amp; NA &amp; 62.27$±$10.62 &amp; NA”.</p>

  <p>where NA indicates the training strategy is not relevant. Another, more recent (2020), SOA classification method Doganay et al [7], rescales images to 256x256. As discussed on page 2 (see “However, recent…”) such scale prevents capturing smaller findings. We have studied the effect of downsampling in Section 3 and Fig. 3, showing that lower resolutions result in worse performance. Moreover, the method of [7] requires annotations at the slice level. These reasons justified our initial choice to not directly compare against [7]. If considered relevant, we can add this comparison to [7] to the experiences in Table 1 as follows “Doganay et al. &amp; NA &amp; 60.47$\pm$8.15 &amp; NA &amp; NA“. We see that on our dataset both SOA methods, [23] without adaption and [7], are outperformed by [23] with adaption and by the proposed method.</p>

  <p>The quality of the slabs produced by our method vs. MIP or SoftMIP (R1, R4) was evaluated indirectly through the classification task (see Table 1) since no direct quantitative metrics exist [6].  Moreover, we note in Fig. 3 that the performance decreases with thicker slabs, validating the interest of multiple thinner slabs, compared to unique volume-wise MIP or SoftMIP projections.</p>

  <p>Regarding the slab thickness (R1 and R4), we draw attention to Fig. 4 and to the “Slab thickness study” paragraph in section 3, where the performance for different thicknesses was reported. R1 suggests we set T also according to the slice spacing, this is what we do as stated in the “Hyper-parameters” paragraph.</p>

  <p>Regarding the R5’s question, 3D deep learning techniques could not be directly applied to full-resolution DBT images due to hardware limitations. That is, a full DBT volume has a size of approx. 60x2500x2000, which can not be fitted for training in modern GPU hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Tesla V100 or RTX 2080 ti).</p>

  <p>Concerning the access to data (R4 and R5), we note that the BCS dataset [3] is public. As for PMV datasets, they can be shared upon justified requests and right-holder approvals. We will mention it in the dataset paragraph of section 3.</p>

  <p>Concerning the bounding box cropping (R1), it is a common preprocessing technique consisting of removing empty background columns and rows of an image. For clarity, we will add a statement in the “Data Preparation” (sec 3) and revise Fig 1.</p>

  <p>Finally, we observed no overfitting (R1) in our experiments. To prevent it we used data augmentation described in “Data preparation” and we rely on transfer learning from a bigger mammography dataset (i.e., 2000 images).</p>
