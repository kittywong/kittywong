<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Jiacong Hu, Zunlei Feng, Yining Mao, Jie Lei, Dan Yu, Mingli Song Abstract The jaw tumors and cysts are usually painless and asymptomatic, which poses a serious threat to patient life quality. Proper and accurate detection at the early stage will effectively relieve patients’ pain and avoid radical segmentation surgery. However, similar radiological characteristics of some tumors and cysts bring challenges for accurate and reliable diagnosis of tumors and cysts. What’s more, existing transfer learning based classification and detection methods for diagnosis of tumors and cysts have two drawbacks: a) diagnosis performance of the model is highly reliant on the number of lesion samples; b) the diagnosis results lack reliability. In this paper, we proposed a Location Constrained Dual-branch Network (LCD-Net) for reliable diagnosis of jaw tumors and cysts. To overcome the dependence on a large number of lesion samples, the features extractor of LCD-Net is pretrained with self-supervised learning on massive healthy samples, which are easier to collect. For similar radiological characteristics, the auxiliary segmentation branch is devised for extracting more distinguishable features. What’s more, the dual-branch network combined with the patch-covering data augmentation strategy and localization consistency loss is proposed to improve the model’s reliability. In the experiment, we collect 872 lesion panoramic radiographs and 10,000 healthy panoramic radiographs. Exhaustive experiments on the collected dataset show that LCD-Net achieves SOTA and reliable performance, which provides an effective tool for diagnosing jaw tumors and cysts.

More details and results of different categories will be added to the final version. b) Please refer to A1 of Reviewer #3. To Reviewer #1 Q1: It would better to compare the results of semantic segmentation only. A1: We thank the reviewer for the positive and constructive comments. The added segmentation results are given in A1 of AC. Q2: This study needs cross- or external- validations. A2: Thanks for the constructive comments. The external validations on 100 new collected samples are given as follows: Classification performance Category Acc. Pre. Sen. Spe.

Due to the limited time of rebuttal, we will update the results with the cross-validations setting in the final version. To Reviewer #2 Q1: Comparison with other general segmentation methods. A1: We thank the reviewer for the positive and constructive comments. Please refer to A1 of AC for the newly added results. Q2: a) 2048 fully connection layer? b）Some other typos. c) Best scores can be emphasized. d) Statistical tests can be added to show significance. A2: Thanks. a) It should be ‘2048 neurons in the fully connection layer’. b) Thanks for point it out. We will carefully check the final version. c) Thanks. It will be emphasized in the final version. d) We will add cross- and external- validations in the final version. Please refer to A2 of Reviewer #1 for more details. To Reviewer #3 Q1: The experimental setting is my main concern. The authors used MoCo V2 to pretrain their LCD-Net. However, The benchmarking methods are used ImageNet pre-trained as initialization, which may not be fair. It validates the effectiveness of MoCo V2, instead of the proposed LCD-Net. A1: The reviewer raises an interesting concern. With only limited lesion samples, all existing methods adopt the pretrain strategy on ImageNet. As far as we know, we are the first to train the network on massive healthy samples using self-supervised learning. The experiment results demonstrate that self-supervised learning combined with massive healthy samples is more appropriate for the strong imbalanced medical image datasets. Just as the comment of Reviewer #1 “This method could show a dedicated method for overcoming strong imbalanced dataset between diseased and massive healthy samples.”. Furthermore, pretraining on ImageNet is the default setting of existing methods [13,11], and self-supervised learning MoCo is not suitable for the detection-based methods [3, 10, 20]. So, we adopt the default setting in the submitted paper. The ablation study of Table 4 demonstrates that other proposed modules (path-covering data augmentation, two-branch framework, location consistency loss) achieve 3~4% improvement individually, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed LCD-Net. back to top" />

To Reviewer #3 Q1: The experimental setting is my main concern. The authors used MoCo V2 to pretrain their LCD-Net. However, The benchmarking methods are used ImageNet pre-trained as initialization, which may not be fair. It validates the effectiveness of MoCo V2, instead of the proposed LCD-Net. A1: The reviewer raises an interesting concern. With only limited lesion samples, all existing methods adopt the pretrain strategy on ImageNet. As far as we know, we are the first to train the network on massive healthy samples using self-supervised learning. The experiment results demonstrate that self-supervised learning combined with massive healthy samples is more appropriate for the strong imbalanced medical image datasets. Just as the comment of Reviewer #1 “This method could show a dedicated method for overcoming strong imbalanced dataset between diseased and massive healthy samples.”. Furthermore, pretraining on ImageNet is the default setting of existing methods [13,11], and self-supervised learning MoCo is not suitable for the detection-based methods [3, 10, 20]. So, we adopt the default setting in the submitted paper. The ablation study of Table 4 demonstrates that other proposed modules (path-covering data augmentation, two-branch framework, location consistency loss) achieve 3~4% improvement individually, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed LCD-Net. back to top" />

Proper and accurate detection at the early stage will effectively relieve patients’ pain and avoid radical segmentation surgery. However, similar radiological characteristics of some tumors and cysts bring challenges for accurate and reliable diagnosis of tumors and cysts. What’s more, existing transfer learning based classification and detection methods for diagnosis of tumors and cysts have two drawbacks: a) diagnosis performance of the model is highly reliant on the number of lesion samples; b) the diagnosis results lack reliability. In this paper, we proposed a Location Constrained Dual-branch Network (LCD-Net) for reliable diagnosis of jaw tumors and cysts. To overcome the dependence on a large number of lesion samples, the features extractor of LCD-Net is pretrained with self-supervised learning on massive healthy samples, which are easier to collect. For similar radiological characteristics, the auxiliary segmentation branch is devised for extracting more distinguishable features. What’s more, the dual-branch network combined with the patch-covering data augmentation strategy and localization consistency loss is proposed to improve the model’s reliability. In the experiment, we collect 872 lesion panoramic radiographs and 10,000 healthy panoramic radiographs. Exhaustive experiments on the collected dataset show that LCD-Net achieves SOTA and reliable performance, which provides an effective tool for diagnosing jaw tumors and cysts.

If you disagree with some of the (meta)reviewer statements, you can indicate so in your meta-review. Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. The authors proposed a network for diagnosing jaw tumors and cysts with one encoder and two decoders (branches). The encoder is pre-trained with massive healthy samples. The two decoders are used to predict the lesion mask and the category, respectively. Two reviewers give relative high scores and one reviewer give relative low scores, who has concerns about the experiment setting. Therefore, the major concern of this paper is the limited experiment results. In the rebuttal, the author conducted a comparison with other general segmentation methods to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Moreover, the experiment setting is clarified. The authors are strongly suggested to add these information to make the final version suitable for the publication. Thus, I would suggest to accept this paper. After you have reviewed the rebuttal, please provide your final rating based on all reviews and the authors’ rebuttal. Accept What is the rank of this paper among all your rebuttal papers? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 4 Meta-Review #2 Please provide your assessment of the paper taking all information into account, including rebuttal. Highlight the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper, clarify how you reconciled contrasting review comments and scores, indicate if concerns were successfully addressed in the rebuttal, and provide a clear justification of your decision. If you disagree with some of the (meta)reviewer statements, you can indicate so in your meta-review. Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. The paper’s method has one encoder and two decoders, one used for segmentation and another for classification. The idea is not new but somehow acceptable. The rebuttal gave some new comparison results. Normally, the paper is not supposed to be revised with new results, but the results look reasonable. I would vote for acceptance of the paper. After you have reviewed the rebuttal, please provide your final rating based on all reviews and the authors’ rebuttal. Accept What is the rank of this paper among all your rebuttal papers? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 4 Meta-Review #3 Please provide your assessment of the paper taking all information into account, including rebuttal.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>The jaw tumors and cysts are usually painless and asymptomatic, which poses a serious threat to patient life quality. Proper and accurate detection at the early stage will effectively relieve patients’ pain and avoid radical segmentation surgery. However, similar radiological characteristics of some tumors and cysts bring challenges for accurate and reliable diagnosis of tumors and cysts. What’s more, existing transfer learning based classification and detection methods for diagnosis of tumors and cysts have two drawbacks: a) diagnosis performance of the model is highly reliant on the number of lesion samples; b) the diagnosis results lack reliability.
In this paper, we proposed a Location Constrained Dual-branch Network (LCD-Net) for reliable diagnosis of jaw tumors and cysts. To overcome the dependence on a large number of lesion samples, the features extractor of LCD-Net is pretrained with self-supervised learning on massive healthy samples, which are easier to collect. For similar radiological characteristics, the auxiliary segmentation branch is devised for extracting more distinguishable features. What’s more, the dual-branch network combined with the patch-covering data augmentation strategy and localization consistency loss is proposed to improve the model’s reliability. In the experiment, we collect 872 lesion panoramic radiographs and 10,000 healthy panoramic radiographs. Exhaustive experiments on the collected dataset show that LCD-Net achieves SOTA and reliable performance, which provides an effective tool for diagnosing jaw tumors and cysts.

      <p>The authors proposed a network for diagnosing jaw tumors and cycsts. The network contains one encoder and two decoders (branches). The encoder is pre-trained with massive healthy samples.

<blockquote>

  <p>We would like to thank the AC and all reviewers for the constructive comments.</p>

  <p>To AC</p>

  <p>Q1: a) Compare with other general segmentation methods; b) Clear and fair experiment setting.
A1: Thanks for the nice comment. a) The comparison results with general segmentation methods (pretrained on massive healthy samples) are given as follows:
Method PA Sen. Spe. mIoU Dice
Unet 67.43 63.18 68.21 69.02 67.35
PSPNet 64.21 58.86 65.62 67.93 65.02
DeeplabV3+ 67.92 64.01 69.27 69.34 68.97
Our 68.11 64.09 70.64 70.84 71.07
Our method achieves about 1~2% improvement than SOTA segmentation methods, which means that the classification branch also helps the segmentation branch to segment lesion area accurately. More details and results of different categories will be added to the final version.
b) Please refer to A1 of Reviewer #3.</p>

  <p>To Reviewer #1</p>

  <p>Q1: It would better to compare the results of semantic segmentation only.
A1: We thank the reviewer for the positive and constructive comments. The added segmentation results are given in A1 of AC.</p>

  <p>Q2: This study needs cross- or external- validations.
A2: Thanks for the constructive comments. The external validations on 100 new collected samples are given as follows:
Classification performance
Category Acc. Pre. Sen. Spe. F1
DCs 83.04 77.93 73.28 90.02 74.32
PCs 86.32 66.94 69.32 90.25 66.21
ABs 91.97 47.48 51.84 95.31 48.32
KCOTs 90.32 58.93 56.21 93.83 57.08
Healthy 83.09 76.05 75.72 86.18 76.32
Means 86.95 65.47 65.27 91.12 64.45 
Segmentation performance
Category PA Sen. Spe. IoU Dice
DCs 68.32 69.04 68.83 70.31 72.81
PCs 69.51 65.82 71.92 68.03 69.03
ABs 66.15 49.31 69.05 66.74 66.38
KCOTs 66.82 66.12 70.58 72.42 71.84
Means 67.70 62.57 70.10 69.38 70.02
Those results are largely consistent with the results in the submitted paper. Due to the limited time of rebuttal, we will update the results with the cross-validations setting in the final version.</p>

  <p>To Reviewer #2</p>

  <p>Q1: Comparison with other general segmentation methods.
A1: We thank the reviewer for the positive and constructive comments. Please refer to A1 of AC for the newly added results.</p>

  <p>Q2: a) 2048 fully connection layer? b）Some other typos. c) Best scores can be emphasized. d) Statistical tests can be added to show significance.
A2: Thanks. a) It should be ‘2048 neurons in the fully connection layer’. b) Thanks for point it out. We will carefully check the final version. c) Thanks. It will be emphasized in the final version. d) We will add cross- and external- validations in the final version. Please refer to A2 of Reviewer #1 for more details.</p>

  <p>To Reviewer #3</p>

  <p>Q1: The experimental setting is my main concern. The authors used MoCo V2 to pretrain their LCD-Net. However, The benchmarking methods are used ImageNet pre-trained as initialization, which may not be fair. It validates the effectiveness of MoCo V2, instead of the proposed LCD-Net.
A1: The reviewer raises an interesting concern. With only limited lesion samples, all existing methods adopt the pretrain strategy on ImageNet. As far as we know, we are the first to train the network on massive healthy samples using self-supervised learning. The experiment results demonstrate that self-supervised learning combined with massive healthy samples is more appropriate for the strong imbalanced medical image datasets. Just as the comment of Reviewer #1 “This method could show a dedicated method for overcoming strong imbalanced dataset between diseased and massive healthy samples.”. Furthermore, pretraining on ImageNet is the default setting of existing methods [13,11], and self-supervised learning MoCo is not suitable for the detection-based methods [3, 10, 20]. So, we adopt the default setting in the submitted paper. The ablation study of Table 4 demonstrates that other proposed modules (path-covering data augmentation, two-branch framework, location consistency loss) achieve 3~4% improvement individually, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed LCD-Net.</p>
