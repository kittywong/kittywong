Arnold Abstract High resolution histology images contain information related to disease prognosis. However, survival prediction based on current clinical grading systems, which rely heavily on a pathologist’s histological assessment, has significant limitations due to the heterogeneity and complexity of tissue phenotypes. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning framework that leverages hierarchical graph-based representations to enable more precise prediction of progression-free survival in prostate cancer patients. Unlike conventional approaches that analyze patch-based or cell-based pathomic features alone without considering their spatial connectivity, we explore multi-scale topological structures of whole slide images in an integrative context. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model for better progression prediction.

The paper describes a method for predicting progression-free survival in prostate cancer whole slide images using local and global graph network representations. The model learns hierarchical graph-based representations starting from nuclei features and aggregating them to represent a region in the WSI. Authors leverage the latest advances in graph-cnn models and contrastive learning to overcome the need for manually labeled regions. The model is trained with a large private dataset of ~22000 WSI and tested in the public TCGA-PRAD dataset. Results show that the model not only outperforms the standard clinical features including the Gleason grade group (c-index of 0.7254 vs 0.7934) but also state-of-the-art deep learning models using multiple instance learning and standard hand-crafted feature-based models.

The authors conduct extensive experiments, including comparisons with conventional methods and widely used MIL based method. Feature selection strategies are also included. Easy to follow. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Some training detail is missing. For example, it does not include the details for the tumour detection model. Is it the same as [13] in the paper? How to finetune the model on a small dataset with coarse contour annotations is also not mentioned. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Excellent Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The authors claim to release the code after being publish. The writing is clear and well-organized. The dataset is publish available. Therefore the reproducibility should be good. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html The authors present a two-stage graph convolutional framework for survival prediction, which captures both cell-based and patch-based features in the hierarchical graph. A contrastive learning-based pre-trained method is used to further improve the representation ability of the network. Experiments on a public dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method. In sum, this paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The proposed hierarchical graph pathomic network is novel. It makes full use of the milti-scale topological structure information in histology image by encoding it through the multi-scale graph network. The experiments are sufficient and results outperform other general methods. Apart from that, I have several questions: It seems that the method use K-NN graph with some distance constrain. How much does the hyperparams in the graph construction affect the method? Comparied with the Attention MIL-based aggregation method, how is the computational cost and the inference speed? How to select the features to construct the graph? Please state your overall opinion of the paper strong accept (9) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? This paper is well-written. The method is novel and has the potential capability to apply on other WSI analysis problems. Experiments are sufficient. Therefore I suggest to give a strong accept.

This paper develops a novel method to integrates cell-level and patch-level graph structures for progression free survival prediction of prostate cancer. The strengths include: 1) this paper is well written and easy to follow; 2) A hierarchical graph network is proposed for survival prediction from pathology images, which has the advantages of the cell graph and the patch graph by capturing the hierarchical information in the pathological images; 3) the recent advanced techniques in GNN and contrastive learning has been integrated together to reduce the need for manually labeled regions. One key issue for this paper is the description of experimental results. The information about training details, hyperparameters, patch selection, fine tuning is missing. Consensus from Reviewers on Acceptance, but with raised questions, such as more detailed experiment settings, hyperparameters, more experiment results and so on.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>High resolution histology images contain information related to disease prognosis. However, survival prediction based on current clinical grading systems, which rely heavily on a pathologist’s histological assessment, has significant limitations due to the heterogeneity and complexity of tissue phenotypes. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning framework that leverages hierarchical graph-based representations to enable more precise prediction of progression-free survival in prostate cancer patients. Unlike conventional approaches that analyze patch-based or cell-based pathomic features alone without considering their spatial connectivity, we explore multi-scale topological structures of whole slide images in an integrative context. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model for better progression prediction.

  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The main contribution of the paper is to integrate multi-scale graph representations and show that is a very good fit for predict progression-free survival in prostate cancer.</p>

      <p>The paper describes a method for predicting progression-free survival in prostate cancer whole slide images using local and global graph network representations.
The model learns hierarchical graph-based representations starting from nuclei features and aggregating them to represent a region in the WSI. 
Authors leverage the latest advances in graph-cnn models and contrastive learning to overcome the need for manually labeled regions.
The model is trained with a large private dataset of ~22000 WSI and tested in the public TCGA-PRAD dataset.
Results show that the model not only outperforms the standard clinical features including the Gleason grade group (c-index of 0.7254 vs 0.7934)  but also state-of-the-art deep learning models using multiple instance learning and standard hand-crafted feature-based models.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The authors present a two-stage graph convolutional framework for survival prediction, which captures both cell-based and patch-based features in the hierarchical graph. A contrastive learning-based pre-trained method is used to further improve the representation ability of the network. Experiments on a public dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

      <p>In sum, this paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The proposed hierarchical graph pathomic network is novel. It makes full use of the milti-scale topological structure information in histology image by encoding it through the multi-scale graph network. The experiments are sufficient and results outperform other general methods.</p>

      <p>Apart from that, I have several questions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>It seems that the method use K-NN graph with some distance constrain.  How much does the hyperparams in the graph construction affect the method?</li>
        <li>Comparied with the Attention MIL-based aggregation method, how is the computational cost and the inference speed?</li>
        <li>How to select the features to construct the graph?</li>
      </ol>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This paper develops a novel method to integrates cell-level and patch-level graph structures for progression free survival prediction of prostate cancer. The strengths include: 1) this paper is well written and easy to follow; 2) A hierarchical graph network is proposed for survival prediction from pathology images, which has the advantages of the cell graph and the patch graph by capturing the hierarchical information in the pathological images; 3) the recent advanced techniques in GNN and contrastive learning has been integrated together to reduce the need for manually labeled regions. One key issue for this paper is the description of experimental results. The information about training details, hyperparameters, patch selection, fine tuning  is missing. Consensus from Reviewers on Acceptance, but with raised questions, such as more detailed experiment settings, hyperparameters, more experiment results and so on.</p>
