<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Jingyun Yang, Jie Hu, Yicong Li, Heng Liu, Yang Li Abstract Among symptoms of cerebral palsy (CP), the degree of hand function impairment in young children is hard to assess due to large inter-personal variability and differences in evaluators’ experience. To help design better treatment strategies, accurate identification and delineation of manual ability injury level is a major clinical concern. Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), a form of brain lesion in periventriular white matter in premature infants, is a leading cause of CP and have clinical associations with motor function injuries. In this paper, we exploit the correlation between PVL lesion segmentation and manual ability classification (MAC) to improve the identification performance of the both tasks for T2 FLAIR MRI scans. Particularly, we propose a semi-supervised multitask learning framework to jointly learn from heterogeneous datasets. Two clinically related auxiliary tasks, lesions localization and ventricle segmentation, are also incorporated to improve the classification accuracy while requiring only a small amount of manual annotations. Using two datasets containing 24 labeled PVL samples and 87 labeled MAC samples, the proposed model significantly outperforms single-task methods, achieving a dice score of 0.607 for PVL lesion segmentation and 84.3\% accuracy for manual ability classification.

If you disagree with some of the (meta)reviewer statements, you can indicate so in your meta-review. Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. This paper presents a semi-supervised multitask learning framework for two tasks periventricular leukomalacia lesion segmentation and manual ability classification on FLAIR MRI. To this end, the proposed method incorporates both lesion localization and ventricle segmentation. Authors assess their method in comparison with a single-task method on two datasets (one containing voxel-wise lesion labels and the other only related to the MAC). The experimental results on cross validation show significantly improvement over the single-task approach. I think the authors clarify most of the points requested by the reviewer, but the one as regards more dataset it is not really addressed. I understand this is challenging for certain populations. In my opinion the work presents a minor methodological contribution and validation is very limited (as for the lesion segmentation task very few subjects are available). In the rebuttal authors indicate that no SOA is available, but they seem to have now another multi-task method and results adapting Ref4, with another task. One one side they mention 2D UNET baseline model, but I though their baseline was 3D, at least it is stated like this in the paper, with an additional classification task. The new results with this additional multi-task approach appear quite similar to their results (0.627 and 0.531 respectively, compared to 0.667 and 0.583) so I would not draw any strong conclusion about the improvement of the proposed method. In fact, this makes me hesitate more about the additional value of this work and bias my decision towards not recommending it for acceptance.

We address the major concerns one by one as follow: 1.Clarification on the Figures Fig.2 shows the architecture of the model which jointly learns a common encoder for all target and auxiliary tasks. The correlation among these tasks enables us to assume that their discriminative features lie in a common multi-scale feature space, represented by the encoder network. 2.Details on Auxiliary Tasks For selecting auxiliary tasks, clinical evidence shows that PVL lesions are always detected regularly in specific locations like the thalamus and basal ganglia, and the area of the ventricle changes due to Leukomalacia. Thus we leverage information learned from Lesion Localization and Ventricle Segmentation to improve the performance of target tasks. Given the training data for lesion segmentation, we automatically create labels for Lesion Localization as follows: extract the topological structure of the lesion shape from the binary segmentation mask by outermost border following (suzuki, 1985) and compute the mass center coordinates using spatial moments. 3.Clarifications on the Dataset: age, modality and data size Dataset1 is captured from PVL patients between 19 to 28 months. Although PVL mostly occurs in newborns, premature infants younger than 1 year old often cannot tolerate MRI examinations, therefore we use MRI images of infants between 1-2 years old who are still in the relatively early stage of PVL. Dataset2 is captured from CP patients with MA tests between 4-12 years old. These children are older since CP is commonly developed from PVL and can only be diagnosed when children are old enough to perform certain physical tasks. Our study uses joint training to learn a better model that predicts MA level based on MRI images, which is a novel design. We choose T2 FLAIR instead of other modalities, as it is sensitive to brain pathological changes and can highlight small lesions around the ventricle. The data from PVL and CP children are difficult to collect and our study is the first to utilize such a systematic dataset to the best of our knowledge. Our framework is therefore specifically geared toward the small data situation. Despite the small dataset size, cross-validation shows that the results are relatively stable. The standard error of MAC is 1.2e-3 and of PVL segmentation is 1.6458e-2 (in SHMN-4 setting). 4.Additional Training Settings: sample size and parameters Model training is done on two datasets containing 24 images with PVL segmentation mask and 87 images with manual ability classification 68 mild, 29 severe respectively. We divide both dataset1 and dataset2 into 70% training, 10% validation and 20% testing for two target tasks. For auxiliary tasks, Lesion Localization is trained on Dataset1 and Ventricle Segmentation is trained on Dataset2, both with a 9:1 trainining-validation split. Due to the image size, 182x218x182, and memory constraints we set a batch size of 2. We use the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 3e-4 and set it to decrease periorically if the losses do not improve enough. During training, coefficients of all tasks are equally set to 1 as our work mainly focuses on the multi-task framework. Better results could be obtained if coefficients are chosen through cross-validation. 5.Additional Comparison with Related Works There is no direct comparison with existing methods since MRI-based MA classification has not been done before. We have compared our model with a SOTA multi-task learning architecture (Ref.4 in paper) which adopts subnets to perform multiple tasks, by augmenting the 2D U-Net basline model with an image classification subnet. Using the same datasets, the accuracy of MAC and dice score of PVL segmentation are 0.627 and 0.531 respectively, compared to 0.667 and 0.583 for our result with SHMN-2. This demonstrates that our architecture choice for multi-task learning is more effective. back to top" />

Given the training data for lesion segmentation, we automatically create labels for Lesion Localization as follows: extract the topological structure of the lesion shape from the binary segmentation mask by outermost border following (suzuki, 1985) and compute the mass center coordinates using spatial moments. 3.Clarifications on the Dataset: age, modality and data size Dataset1 is captured from PVL patients between 19 to 28 months. Although PVL mostly occurs in newborns, premature infants younger than 1 year old often cannot tolerate MRI examinations, therefore we use MRI images of infants between 1-2 years old who are still in the relatively early stage of PVL. Dataset2 is captured from CP patients with MA tests between 4-12 years old. These children are older since CP is commonly developed from PVL and can only be diagnosed when children are old enough to perform certain physical tasks. Our study uses joint training to learn a better model that predicts MA level based on MRI images, which is a novel design. We choose T2 FLAIR instead of other modalities, as it is sensitive to brain pathological changes and can highlight small lesions around the ventricle. The data from PVL and CP children are difficult to collect and our study is the first to utilize such a systematic dataset to the best of our knowledge. Our framework is therefore specifically geared toward the small data situation. Despite the small dataset size, cross-validation shows that the results are relatively stable. The standard error of MAC is 1.2e-3 and of PVL segmentation is 1.6458e-2 (in SHMN-4 setting). 4.Additional Training Settings: sample size and parameters Model training is done on two datasets containing 24 images with PVL segmentation mask and 87 images with manual ability classification 68 mild, 29 severe respectively. We divide both dataset1 and dataset2 into 70% training, 10% validation and 20% testing for two target tasks. For auxiliary tasks, Lesion Localization is trained on Dataset1 and Ventricle Segmentation is trained on Dataset2, both with a 9:1 trainining-validation split. Due to the image size, 182x218x182, and memory constraints we set a batch size of 2. We use the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 3e-4 and set it to decrease periorically if the losses do not improve enough. During training, coefficients of all tasks are equally set to 1 as our work mainly focuses on the multi-task framework. Better results could be obtained if coefficients are chosen through cross-validation. 5.Additional Comparison with Related Works There is no direct comparison with existing methods since MRI-based MA classification has not been done before. We have compared our model with a SOTA multi-task learning architecture (Ref.4 in paper) which adopts subnets to perform multiple tasks, by augmenting the 2D U-Net basline model with an image classification subnet. Using the same datasets, the accuracy of MAC and dice score of PVL segmentation are 0.627 and 0.531 respectively, compared to 0.667 and 0.583 for our result with SHMN-2. This demonstrates that our architecture choice for multi-task learning is more effective. back to top" />

To help design better treatment strategies, accurate identification and delineation of manual ability injury level is a major clinical concern. Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), a form of brain lesion in periventriular white matter in premature infants, is a leading cause of CP and have clinical associations with motor function injuries. In this paper, we exploit the correlation between PVL lesion segmentation and manual ability classification (MAC) to improve the identification performance of the both tasks for T2 FLAIR MRI scans. Particularly, we propose a semi-supervised multitask learning framework to jointly learn from heterogeneous datasets. Two clinically related auxiliary tasks, lesions localization and ventricle segmentation, are also incorporated to improve the classification accuracy while requiring only a small amount of manual annotations. Using two datasets containing 24 labeled PVL samples and 87 labeled MAC samples, the proposed model significantly outperforms single-task methods, achieving a dice score of 0.607 for PVL lesion segmentation and 84.3\\% accuracy for manual ability classification.

In case of an invitation for rebuttal, clarify which points are important to address in the rebuttal. In this paper, the authors utilized multi-task learning to improve the interpretability of the features encoded from the deep learning network and in turn increase the MAC accuracy and PVL detection. There are several strengths: First, the method proposed is not complicated, but very clever and useful, both the MAC and Lesions segmentation were significantly increased. Second, lesion localization and ventricle segmentation were incorporated as two clinically related auxiliary tasks to improve the classification accuracy while requiring only a small amount of manual annotations. In addition, two different datasets are considered in the experiments. There are some weaknesses: First, many relevant parameters that are required to train the framework are missing, making it hard to reproduce the results. Second, the proposed method is only verified on a small dataset without comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, whose superiority is not convincing. When resubmitting, some problems to be addressed are listed below: 1)The authors need to express clearly the correlation between PVL segmentation and manual ability classification in Fig. 2. 2)The authors need to explain how to define each lesion center. 3)In the experiment, the authors did not provide clear descriptions of the training, validation, and testing data. 4)In the experiment, the authors did not provide detailed experimental settings. 5)As the experimental data is a little bit small, the authors need to carry out the proposed model on more data, which is more convincing. 6)There are some typos and grammar errors, such as “lesions localization” vs. “lesion localization” and “ventricle segmentation”.

Highlight the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper, clarify how you reconciled contrasting review comments and scores, indicate if concerns were successfully addressed in the rebuttal, and provide a clear justification of your decision. If you disagree with some of the (meta)reviewer statements, you can indicate so in your meta-review. Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. This paper presents a semi-supervised multitask learning framework for two tasks periventricular leukomalacia lesion segmentation and manual ability classification on FLAIR MRI. To this end, the proposed method incorporates both lesion localization and ventricle segmentation. Authors assess their method in comparison with a single-task method on two datasets (one containing voxel-wise lesion labels and the other only related to the MAC). The experimental results on cross validation show significantly improvement over the single-task approach. I think the authors clarify most of the points requested by the reviewer, but the one as regards more dataset it is not really addressed. I understand this is challenging for certain populations. In my opinion the work presents a minor methodological contribution and validation is very limited (as for the lesion segmentation task very few subjects are available). In the rebuttal authors indicate that no SOA is available, but they seem to have now another multi-task method and results adapting Ref4, with another task. One one side they mention 2D UNET baseline model, but I though their baseline was 3D, at least it is stated like this in the paper, with an additional classification task. The new results with this additional multi-task approach appear quite similar to their results (0.627 and 0.531 respectively, compared to 0.667 and 0.583) so I would not draw any strong conclusion about the improvement of the proposed method. In fact, this makes me hesitate more about the additional value of this work and bias my decision towards not recommending it for acceptance. After you have reviewed the rebuttal, please provide your final rating based on all reviews and the authors’ rebuttal. Reject What is the rank of this paper among all your rebuttal papers?

We address the major concerns one by one as follow: 1.Clarification on the Figures Fig.2 shows the architecture of the model which jointly learns a common encoder for all target and auxiliary tasks. The correlation among these tasks enables us to assume that their discriminative features lie in a common multi-scale feature space, represented by the encoder network. 2.Details on Auxiliary Tasks For selecting auxiliary tasks, clinical evidence shows that PVL lesions are always detected regularly in specific locations like the thalamus and basal ganglia, and the area of the ventricle changes due to Leukomalacia. Thus we leverage information learned from Lesion Localization and Ventricle Segmentation to improve the performance of target tasks. Given the training data for lesion segmentation, we automatically create labels for Lesion Localization as follows: extract the topological structure of the lesion shape from the binary segmentation mask by outermost border following (suzuki, 1985) and compute the mass center coordinates using spatial moments. 3.Clarifications on the Dataset: age, modality and data size Dataset1 is captured from PVL patients between 19 to 28 months. Although PVL mostly occurs in newborns, premature infants younger than 1 year old often cannot tolerate MRI examinations, therefore we use MRI images of infants between 1-2 years old who are still in the relatively early stage of PVL. Dataset2 is captured from CP patients with MA tests between 4-12 years old. These children are older since CP is commonly developed from PVL and can only be diagnosed when children are old enough to perform certain physical tasks. Our study uses joint training to learn a better model that predicts MA level based on MRI images, which is a novel design. We choose T2 FLAIR instead of other modalities, as it is sensitive to brain pathological changes and can highlight small lesions around the ventricle. The data from PVL and CP children are difficult to collect and our study is the first to utilize such a systematic dataset to the best of our knowledge. Our framework is therefore specifically geared toward the small data situation. Despite the small dataset size, cross-validation shows that the results are relatively stable. The standard error of MAC is 1.2e-3 and of PVL segmentation is 1.6458e-2 (in SHMN-4 setting). 4.Additional Training Settings: sample size and parameters Model training is done on two datasets containing 24 images with PVL segmentation mask and 87 images with manual ability classification 68 mild, 29 severe respectively. We divide both dataset1 and dataset2 into 70% training, 10% validation and 20% testing for two target tasks. For auxiliary tasks, Lesion Localization is trained on Dataset1 and Ventricle Segmentation is trained on Dataset2, both with a 9:1 trainining-validation split. Due to the image size, 182x218x182, and memory constraints we set a batch size of 2. We use the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 3e-4 and set it to decrease periorically if the losses do not improve enough. During training, coefficients of all tasks are equally set to 1 as our work mainly focuses on the multi-task framework. Better results could be obtained if coefficients are chosen through cross-validation. 5.Additional Comparison with Related Works There is no direct comparison with existing methods since MRI-based MA classification has not been done before. We have compared our model with a SOTA multi-task learning architecture (Ref.4 in paper) which adopts subnets to perform multiple tasks, by augmenting the 2D U-Net basline model with an image classification subnet. Using the same datasets, the accuracy of MAC and dice score of PVL segmentation are 0.627 and 0.531 respectively, compared to 0.667 and 0.583 for our result with SHMN-2. This demonstrates that our architecture choice for multi-task learning is more effective. back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Among symptoms of cerebral palsy (CP), the degree of hand function impairment in young children is hard to assess  due to large inter-personal variability  and differences in evaluators’ experience.  To help design better treatment strategies, accurate identification and delineation of manual ability injury level  is a major clinical concern.   Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), a form of brain lesion in periventriular white matter in premature infants, is   a leading cause of CP and have clinical associations with motor function injuries. In this paper, we exploit the correlation between PVL lesion segmentation and manual ability classification (MAC) to improve the identification performance of the both tasks for T2 FLAIR MRI scans. Particularly, we propose a semi-supervised multitask learning framework to jointly learn from heterogeneous datasets. Two clinically related auxiliary tasks, lesions localization and ventricle segmentation, are also incorporated to improve the classification accuracy while requiring only a small amount of manual annotations.  Using two datasets containing  24 labeled PVL samples and 87 labeled MAC samples, the proposed model significantly outperforms single-task methods, achieving a dice score of 0.607 for PVL lesion segmentation and 84.3\% accuracy for manual ability classification.

    <blockquote>
      <p>This paper presents a semi-supervised multitask learning framework for two tasks periventricular leukomalacia lesion segmentation and manual ability classification on FLAIR MRI. To this end, the proposed method incorporates both lesion localization and ventricle segmentation. Authors assess their method in comparison with a single-task method on two datasets (one containing voxel-wise lesion labels and the other only related to the MAC). The experimental results on cross validation show significantly improvement over the single-task approach.</p>

      <p>I think the authors clarify most of the points requested by the reviewer, but the one as regards more dataset it is not really addressed. I understand this is challenging for certain populations.</p>

      <p>In my opinion the work presents a minor methodological contribution and validation is very limited (as for the lesion segmentation task very few subjects are available).  In the rebuttal authors indicate that no SOA is available, but they seem to have now another multi-task method and results adapting Ref4, with another task. One one side they mention 2D UNET baseline model, but I though their baseline was 3D, at least it is stated like this in the paper, with an additional classification task. The new results with this additional multi-task approach appear quite similar to their results (0.627 and 0.531 respectively, compared to 0.667 and 0.583) so I would not draw any strong conclusion about the improvement of the proposed method. In fact, this makes me hesitate more about the additional value of this work and bias my decision towards not recommending it for acceptance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We would like to express our sincere thanks to three reviewers for their valuable comments. We address the major concerns one by one as follow:
1.Clarification on the Figures
Fig.2 shows the architecture of the model which jointly learns a common encoder for all target and auxiliary tasks. The correlation among these tasks enables us to assume that their discriminative features lie in a common multi-scale feature space, represented by the encoder network.</p>

  <p>2.Details on Auxiliary Tasks
For selecting auxiliary tasks, clinical evidence shows that PVL lesions are always detected regularly in specific locations like the thalamus and basal ganglia, and the area of the ventricle changes due to Leukomalacia. Thus we leverage information learned from Lesion Localization and Ventricle Segmentation to improve the performance of target tasks. 
Given the training data for lesion segmentation, we automatically create labels for Lesion Localization as follows: extract the topological structure of the lesion shape from the binary segmentation mask by outermost border following (suzuki, 1985) and compute the mass center coordinates using spatial moments.</p>

  <p>3.Clarifications on the Dataset: age, modality and data size
Dataset1 is captured from PVL patients between 19 to 28 months. Although PVL mostly occurs in newborns, premature infants younger than 1 year old often cannot tolerate MRI examinations, therefore we use MRI images of infants between 1-2 years old who are still in the relatively early stage of PVL. Dataset2 is captured from CP patients with MA tests between 4-12 years old. These children are older since CP is commonly developed from PVL and can only be diagnosed when children are old enough to perform certain physical tasks. Our study uses joint training to learn a better model that predicts MA level based on MRI images, which is a novel design.
We choose T2 FLAIR instead of other modalities, as it is sensitive to brain pathological changes and can highlight small lesions around the ventricle.
The data from PVL and CP children are difficult to collect and our study is the first to utilize such a systematic dataset to the best of our knowledge. Our framework is therefore specifically geared toward the small data situation. Despite the small dataset size, cross-validation shows that the results are relatively stable. The standard error of MAC is 1.2e-3 and of PVL segmentation is 1.6458e-2 (in SHMN-4 setting).</p>

  <p>4.Additional Training Settings: sample size and parameters
Model training is done on two datasets containing 24 images with PVL segmentation mask and 87 images with manual ability classification 68 mild, 29 severe respectively. We divide both dataset1 and dataset2 into 70% training, 10% validation and 20% testing for two target tasks. For auxiliary tasks, Lesion Localization is trained on Dataset1 and Ventricle Segmentation is trained on Dataset2, both with a 9:1 trainining-validation split. Due to the image size, 182x218x182, and memory constraints we set a batch size of 2. We use the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 3e-4 and set it to decrease periorically if the losses do not improve enough. During training, coefficients of all tasks are equally set to 1 as our work mainly focuses on the multi-task framework. Better results could be obtained if coefficients are chosen through cross-validation.</p>

  <p>5.Additional Comparison with Related Works
There is no direct comparison with existing methods since MRI-based MA classification has not been done before. We have compared our model with a SOTA multi-task learning architecture (Ref.4 in paper) which adopts subnets to perform multiple tasks, by augmenting the 2D U-Net basline model with an image classification subnet. Using the same datasets, the accuracy of MAC and dice score of PVL segmentation are 0.627 and 0.531 respectively, compared to 0.667 and 0.583 for our result with SHMN-2. This demonstrates that our architecture choice for multi-task learning is more effective.</p>
