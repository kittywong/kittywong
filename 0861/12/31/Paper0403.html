<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Ruiheng Chang, Dong Wang, Haiyan Guo, Jia Ding, Liwei Wang Abstract Ultrasound segmentation models provide powerful tools for the diagnosis process of ultrasound examinations. However, developing such models for ultrasound videos requires densely annotated segmentation masks for all frames in a dataset, which is unpractical and unaffordable. Therefore, we propose a weakly-supervised learning (WSL) approach to accomplish the goal of video-based ultrasound segmentation. By only annotating the location of the start and end frames of the lesions, we obtain frame-level binary labels for WSL. We design Video Co-Attention Network to learn the correspondence between frames, where CAM and co-CAM will be obtained to perform lesion localization. Moreover, we find that the essential factor to the success of extracting video-level information is applying our proposed consistency regularization between CAM and co-CAM. Our method achieves an mIoU score of 45.43\% in the breast ultrasound dataset, which significantly outperforms the baseline methods. The codes of our models will be released. Link to paper https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-87237-3_62 Link to the code repository N/A Link to the dataset(s) N/A Reviews Review #1 Please describe the contribution of the paper This paper presents a weakly-supervised ultrasound video segmentation method in the context of breast lesion. The locations of the start and end frames of the lesions are the only source of supervision for the task of lesion segmentation, hence this work falls in the category of “weakly-supervised learning”. The author proposes a co-attention mechanism that learns the frame-wise correspondence and utilizes and optimize class activation maps (CAM) to segment lesion. The proposed method outperforms baseline models in terms of the mIoU score. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The strengths of the paper are listed as follows in terms of technical contributions and clinical relevance: The paper is relatively easy to follow in terms of technical expression. It is well organized and self-contained. Most details are well conveyed. The investigated issue involves segmenting lesions from ultrasound videos, which is of certain clinical relevance to provide real-time feedbacks during breast ultrasound examination . The proposed video co-attention network is of certain technical novelty. The author introduces a co-attention module that models correlation between the CAM of two frames. By applying a consistency loss, CAM’s bias towards larger region is alleviated to some extent. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The weakness of the paper is listed as follows in terms of technical details: In terms of experimental results, it is usually expected to conduct cross-validation and statistical hypothesis testing for in-house dataset. This part is missing in the paper. Section 4.4 Ablation study is actually about hyper-parameter tuning. The reviewer is expected that the impact of three loss terms were analyzed respectively. How important is the nGWP structure as a practical design choice? In video-related analysis, the processing speed in terms of frame-per-second is a key factor to consider. This is missing in the experimental section. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Very Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The author claims to open-source the code. The reviewer wonders whether the in-house dataset shall be released as well. The architecture is well explained. Overall, the reproducibility should be good. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html The reviewer suggests to enrich the experimental results with cross-validation and further ablation studies as stated in Question 5. The baselines do not contain any published work, such as literature [1] and [20]. It is expected to benchmark more widely, especially for a in-house dataset. Put at least one figure of segmentation results that contain comparisons between baselines in the main paper, not the supplementary material.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Ultrasound segmentation models provide powerful tools for the diagnosis process of ultrasound examinations. However, developing such models for ultrasound videos requires densely annotated segmentation masks for all frames in a dataset, which is unpractical and unaffordable. Therefore, we propose a weakly-supervised learning (WSL) approach to accomplish the goal of video-based ultrasound segmentation. By only annotating the location of the start and end frames of the lesions, we obtain frame-level binary labels for WSL. We design Video Co-Attention Network to learn the correspondence between frames, where CAM and co-CAM will be obtained to perform lesion localization. Moreover, we find that the essential factor to the success of extracting video-level information is applying our proposed consistency regularization between CAM and co-CAM. Our method achieves an mIoU score of 45.43\% in the breast ultrasound dataset, which significantly outperforms the baseline methods. The codes of our models will be released.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This paper presents a weakly-supervised ultrasound video segmentation method in the context of breast lesion. The locations of the start and end frames of the lesions are the only source of supervision for the task of lesion segmentation, hence this work falls in the category of “weakly-supervised learning”. The author proposes a co-attention mechanism that learns the frame-wise correspondence and utilizes and optimize class activation maps (CAM) to segment lesion. The proposed method outperforms baseline models in terms of the mIoU score.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The strengths of the paper are listed as follows in terms of technical contributions and clinical relevance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The paper is relatively easy to follow in terms of technical expression. It is well organized and self-contained. Most details are well conveyed. The investigated issue involves segmenting lesions from ultrasound videos, which is of certain clinical relevance to provide real-time feedbacks during breast ultrasound examination .</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The proposed video co-attention network is of certain technical novelty. The author introduces a co-attention module that models correlation between the CAM of two frames. By applying a consistency loss, CAM’s bias towards larger region is alleviated to some extent.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The weakness of the paper is listed as follows in terms of technical details:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>In terms of experimental results, it is usually expected to conduct cross-validation and statistical hypothesis testing for in-house dataset. This part is missing in the paper.</li>
        <li>Section 4.4 Ablation study is actually about hyper-parameter tuning. The reviewer is expected that the impact of three loss terms were analyzed respectively. How important is the nGWP structure as a practical design choice?</li>
        <li>In video-related analysis, the processing speed in terms of frame-per-second is a key factor to consider. This is missing in the experimental section.</li>
      </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The author claims to open-source the code. The reviewer wonders whether the in-house dataset shall be released as well. The architecture is well explained. Overall, the reproducibility should be good.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The reviewer suggests to enrich the experimental results with cross-validation and further ablation studies as stated in Question 5.</li>
        <li>The baselines do not contain any published work, such as literature [1] and [20]. It is expected to benchmark more widely, especially for a in-house dataset.</li>
