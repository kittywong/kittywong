Although progress has been made, performance still needs to be improved especially for the images with motion artifacts (due to unpredictable fetal movement) and/or changes of magnetic field. In this paper, we propose a novel confidence-aware cascaded framework to accurately extract fetal brain from MR image. Different from the existing coarse-to-fine techniques, our two-stage strategy aims to segment brain region and simultaneously produce segmentation confidence for each slice in 3D MR image. Then, the image slices with high-confidence scores are leveraged to guide brain segmentation of low-confidence image slices, especially on the brain regions with blurred boundaries. Furthermore, a slice consistence loss is also proposed to enhance the relationship among the segmentations of adjacent slices. Experimental results on fetal brain MRI dataset show that our proposed model achieves superior performance, and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

The main contribution of the paper is the definition of a method to include the segmentation confidence in specific slices of the stack in order to increase segmentation accuracy in regions of the volumes affected by image distortions (prob due to motion, magnetic field effects). Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The paper is well written and the presentation is clear. The method is explained in sufficient detail and the evaluation is appropriate. The results compare favorably to a range of previous methods. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. While it is of course preferential to include the whole segmentation in a single framework, I cannot help but wonder how the results compare to simple post-processing such as through-slice smoothing (maybe median-filtering) of any of the other proposed methods. Also, the novelty of the method is somewhat questionable, as measures of inter-slice consistency have been used in segmentation tasks before (see for instance 10.1155/2018/4185279) Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance Reproducibility of the paper is rather low. Only proprietary data was used and no code is provided. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html Apart from the general comments raised before, the authors should re-format their formulas: use only single letters as variables (eg “GT_s” in eq. (1)), “Entropy(t) in eq. (2). Also, the first sentence in 2.2 is not a complete sentence, and there is a typo in 3.1 (“sacns” instead of “scans”) Please state your overall opinion of the paper borderline accept (6) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? While the method’s novelty is at least conceptually questionable, the comparison with other methods on the same task is very exhaustive and favorable to the presented method. I would therefore recommend acceptance of the paper, albeit weakly.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Fetal brain segmentation from Magnetic Resonance (MR) images is a fundamental step in brain development study and early diagnosis. Although progress has been made, performance still needs to be improved especially for the images with motion artifacts (due to unpredictable fetal movement) and/or changes of magnetic field. In this paper, we propose a novel confidence-aware cascaded framework to accurately extract fetal brain from MR image. Different from the existing coarse-to-fine techniques, our two-stage strategy aims to segment brain region and simultaneously produce segmentation confidence for each slice in 3D MR image. Then, the image slices with high-confidence scores are leveraged to guide brain segmentation of low-confidence image slices, especially on the brain regions with blurred boundaries. Furthermore, a slice consistence loss is also proposed to enhance the relationship among the segmentations of adjacent slices. Experimental results on fetal brain MRI dataset show that our proposed model achieves superior performance, and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In this paper, the authors propose a method to delineate the brain of fetuses in anisotropic stacks of in-utero MRI scans. The main contribution of the paper is the definition of a method to include the segmentation confidence in specific slices of the stack in order to increase segmentation accuracy in regions of the volumes affected by image distortions (prob due to motion, magnetic field effects).</p>
    </blockquote>

  <li><strong>Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work.

      <p>The paper is well written and the presentation is clear. The method is explained in sufficient detail and the evaluation is appropriate. The results compare favorably to a range of previous methods.</p>
    </blockquote>

  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>While it is of course preferential to include the whole segmentation in a single framework, I cannot help but wonder how the results compare to simple post-processing such as through-slice smoothing (maybe median-filtering) of any of the other proposed methods. 
Also, the novelty of the method is somewhat questionable, as measures of inter-slice consistency have been used in segmentation tasks before (see for instance 10.1155/2018/4185279)</p>

      <p>Apart from the general comments raised before, the authors should re-format their formulas: use only single letters as variables (eg “GT_s” in eq. (1)), “Entropy(t) in eq. (2).

      <p>This paper presents a confidence-aware multi-stage 2D segmentation framework to perform fetal brain segmentation in 3D MR images. In particular, a localization model was used to coarsely localize the brain regions and to calculate the confidence of the segmentation. Fetal MRI scans usually suffer from motion artifacts, thus, the proposed framework with confidence loss makes sense. Experimental results show improved performance compared to several existing segmentation frameworks. I would like to suggest the authors to carefully revise the Guidance Module, which is inconsistent with the Figure 2, i.e. the softmax operation is absent in the description.</p>

      <p>This paper introduces a cascaded network to segment brain from MRI. The pipeline included two networks, first stage coarsely segment brain and generate segmentation certainty per slice.

    <blockquote>
      <p>The proposed method Using cascaded networks for detecting slices with low confidence and using neighboring slices for generating segmentation is novel. 
The ablation evaluation and comparing with state-of-art methods are nicely done</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Dataset: The dataset is not describes well especially what proportion of slices had artifacts, are they included in the training set? How GT has been done on slices with sever artifacts? Did doctors segment based on neighboring slices?
and the evaluation could have been reported separately on slices with artifacts
Fetal MRI suffer from inter slice movements, consistency loss optimizing prediction with neighboring slice using coordinates. This assumption is only true if images are well registered. 
It is mentioned bias field correction method was applied on all images in page6, figures 3, 4 illustrated bias field artifacts. Was that method did not work or figures are made prior to processing?
Method: the confidence measurements are not pixel level but slice. Considering many slices only part of slice has artifact not the entire slice</p>
