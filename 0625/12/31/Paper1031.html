<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Hangfan Liu, Tanweer Rashid, Jeffrey Ware, Paul Jensen, Thomas Austin, Ilya Nasrallah, Robert Bryan, Susan Heckbert, Mohamad Habes Abstract Deep learning for medical image analysis requires large quantities of high-quality imaging data for training purposes, which could be often less available due to ex-istence of heavy noise in particular imaging modalities. This issue is especially obvious in cerebral microbleed (CMB) detection, since CMBs are more discerna-ble on long echo time (TE) susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) data, which are unfortunately much noisier than those with shorter TE. In this paper we present an effective unsupervised image denoising scheme with application to boosting the performance of deep learning based CMB detection. The proposed content-adaptive denoising technique uses the log-determinant of covariance matrices formed by highly correlated image contents retrieved from the input itself to im-plicitly and efficiently exploit sparsity in PCA domain. The numerical solution to the corresponding optimization problem comes down to an adaptive squeeze-and-shrink (ASAS) operation on the underlying PCA coefficients. Obviously, the ASAS denoising does not rely on any external dataset and could be better fit the input image data. Experiments on medical image datasets with synthetic Gaussian white noise demonstrate that the proposed ASAS scheme is highly competitive among state-of-the-art sparsity based approaches as well as deep learning based method. When applied to the deep learning based CMB detection on the real-world TE3 SWI dataset, the proposed ASAS denoising could improve the preci-sion by 18.03%, sensitivity by 7.64%, and increase the correlation between counts of ground truth and automated detection by 19.87%.

This paper proposed Adaptive Squeeze-and-Shrink Image Denoising method, together with deep network, for detection of cerebral microbleeds. It is shown that the denoising can improve the detection task. The reviewers mostly feel positive and have questions on the non-realistic Gaussian noises, comparison with DnCNN, precision of improvement, etc. The response clearly clarified these points. One remaining question is on the comparisons with SOTA, since in denoising, DnCNN is not SOTA, and many learning-based methods have been proposed in medical image denoising, recently. However, considering that this proposed method is unsupervised and has merits in the framework of traditional denoising framework, the paper can be accepted.

Comment: Since noise in most medical images is not Gaussian, the chosen Gaussian model for the noise should be justified. (R1, Meta-R2) Answer: We did not assume the noise to be Gaussian distributed; in fact, the proposed method does not depend on the distribution of noise. We only used Gaussian white noise as the synthetic noise in Sec. 4 to evaluate the denoising performance, because it is the most widely used noise model for testing denoising methods. Please note that in Sec. 5 we used real-world clinical data, in which the noise distribution is unknown, but the proposed approach is still demonstrated effective, as shown by the visual comparison in Fig. 4 and the improved cerebral microbleed (CMB) detection performance in Table 2. Comment: In Table 1, the performance of DnCNN [15] is inferior to BM3D, but literatures (e.g., [15]) have demonstrated that DnCNN is better than BM3D. (R1) Answer: Previous works usually test DnCNN on natural image datasets such as BSD68 [15], on which DnCNN indeed exhibits superior performance. However, such superiority partially relies on the closeness of the training data and the testing data. When the test set is dissimilar with the training set, the trained model may not fit the test data so well. The results in Table 1 indicate that DnCNN may not be well generalized to the medical image datasets like DX and MMM. In contrast, BM3D and the proposed ASAS do not rely on training data and are better at generalization. Comment: Denoised images inevitably lose details. It is not clear why denoising can help detection. (R1) Answer: By pursuing optimal signal-adaptive sparsity, the proposed ASAS strives to preserve the fine details while removing noise. Since the image contents of interest are well preserved and the interference of noise is effectively suppressed (see Fig. 4), the proposed ASAS not only significantly reduces false positives, but also makes the lesions more discernable and thus increases true positives. Besides, when data size is limited, using data with higher quality could improve the performance of the deep learning model. Comment: The improvement of precision should be 5%, rather than 18.03%. (R4) Answer: By saying “ASAS denoising improved the precision by 18.03%” we meant relative improvement, which is calculated by (P_denoised–P_original)/P_original=(0.3286-0.2784)/0.2784=18.03%, while the reviewer considers the absolute improvement, which is P_denoised–P_original=0.3286-0.2784=0.0502. Comment: It’s not clear why there is a point with 0 precision and 0 sensitivity in Fig. 5. (R4) Answer: One of the subjects in the dataset doesn’t have any CMB, hence the corresponding true positive is 0 and both precision and sensitivity were trivially set to 0. Comment: The author should better clarify the contributions of their work. (Meta-R2) Answer: We combined a novel unsupervised denoising scheme ASAS and a deep learning model to tackle the challenging problem of CMB detection. The proposed ASAS achieves signal-adaptive sparsity without explicit dictionary training. We revealed that ASAS essentially applies adaptive squeeze-and-shrink operations to the eigenvalues. When tested on real-world clinical data, ASAS significantly improved the performance of the deep neural network for CMB detection. Comment: The compared methods are not the most recent ones. (R1, R4) Answer: We used BM3D [7], CSR [9] and DnCNN [15] for comparison, considering that BM3D is the most widely-used benchmark for denoising in recent years, CSR is a typical and successful sparsity based method and is in the same category as the proposed ASAS, and DnCNN is a representative deep learning based denoising method. Table 1 shows that ASAS is highly competitive. Comment: In Sec. 2.2: The left side equation is wrong though the right side one is true. This is easy to solve. (R2) Answer: We thank the reviewer for the kind reminder. We’ll correct the typo. back to top" />

(R4) Answer: By saying “ASAS denoising improved the precision by 18.03%” we meant relative improvement, which is calculated by (P_denoised–P_original)/P_original=(0.3286-0.2784)/0.2784=18.03%, while the reviewer considers the absolute improvement, which is P_denoised–P_original=0.3286-0.2784=0.0502. Comment: It’s not clear why there is a point with 0 precision and 0 sensitivity in Fig. 5. (R4) Answer: One of the subjects in the dataset doesn’t have any CMB, hence the corresponding true positive is 0 and both precision and sensitivity were trivially set to 0. Comment: The author should better clarify the contributions of their work. (Meta-R2) Answer: We combined a novel unsupervised denoising scheme ASAS and a deep learning model to tackle the challenging problem of CMB detection. The proposed ASAS achieves signal-adaptive sparsity without explicit dictionary training. We revealed that ASAS essentially applies adaptive squeeze-and-shrink operations to the eigenvalues. When tested on real-world clinical data, ASAS significantly improved the performance of the deep neural network for CMB detection. Comment: The compared methods are not the most recent ones. (R1, R4) Answer: We used BM3D [7], CSR [9] and DnCNN [15] for comparison, considering that BM3D is the most widely-used benchmark for denoising in recent years, CSR is a typical and successful sparsity based method and is in the same category as the proposed ASAS, and DnCNN is a representative deep learning based denoising method. Table 1 shows that ASAS is highly competitive. Comment: In Sec. 2.2: The left side equation is wrong though the right side one is true. This is easy to solve. (R2) Answer: We thank the reviewer for the kind reminder. We’ll correct the typo. back to top" />

This issue is especially obvious in cerebral microbleed (CMB) detection, since CMBs are more discerna-ble on long echo time (TE) susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) data, which are unfortunately much noisier than those with shorter TE. In this paper we present an effective unsupervised image denoising scheme with application to boosting the performance of deep learning based CMB detection. The proposed content-adaptive denoising technique uses the log-determinant of covariance matrices formed by highly correlated image contents retrieved from the input itself to im-plicitly and efficiently exploit sparsity in PCA domain. The numerical solution to the corresponding optimization problem comes down to an adaptive squeeze-and-shrink (ASAS) operation on the underlying PCA coefficients. Obviously, the ASAS denoising does not rely on any external dataset and could be better fit the input image data. Experiments on medical image datasets with synthetic Gaussian white noise demonstrate that the proposed ASAS scheme is highly competitive among state-of-the-art sparsity based approaches as well as deep learning based method. When applied to the deep learning based CMB detection on the real-world TE3 SWI dataset, the proposed ASAS denoising could improve the preci-sion by 18.03%, sensitivity by 7.64%, and increase the correlation between counts of ground truth and automated detection by 19.87%.

Experiments show that the proposed method (ASAS) is beneficial to the accuracy of CMB detection. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The writing is good. The proposed method seems reasonable. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The main weakness of this paper is the experiment. The reported experimental results are not convincing. The noise in most medical images is not Gaussian. Table 1. The performance of DnCNN is inferior to BM3D. These results are weird. Many literatures [1] have demonstrated that DnCNN is better than BM3D (especially for Gaussian noise). Lack of comparisons with recent unsupervised denoising methods (e.g. Noise2Void [2], Self2Self [3]). A denoised image will inevitably lose some image details. It is not clear why denoising can help detection. [1]Kai Zhang. “Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser: Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising”. IEEE TIP, 2017.

Highlight the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper, clarify how you reconciled contrasting review comments and scores, indicate if concerns were successfully addressed in the rebuttal, and provide a clear justification of your decision. If you disagree with some of the (meta)reviewer statements, you can indicate so in your meta-review. Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. This paper proposed Adaptive Squeeze-and-Shrink Image Denoising method, together with deep network, for detection of cerebral microbleeds. It is shown that the denoising can improve the detection task. The reviewers mostly feel positive and have questions on the non-realistic Gaussian noises, comparison with DnCNN, precision of improvement, etc. The response clearly clarified these points. One remaining question is on the comparisons with SOTA, since in denoising, DnCNN is not SOTA, and many learning-based methods have been proposed in medical image denoising, recently. However, considering that this proposed method is unsupervised and has merits in the framework of traditional denoising framework, the paper can be accepted. After you have reviewed the rebuttal, please provide your final rating based on all reviews and the authors’ rebuttal. Accept What is the rank of this paper among all your rebuttal papers? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 9 Author Feedback We thank the reviewers for their efforts in reviewing the paper. Comment: Since noise in most medical images is not Gaussian, the chosen Gaussian model for the noise should be justified. (R1, Meta-R2) Answer: We did not assume the noise to be Gaussian distributed; in fact, the proposed method does not depend on the distribution of noise. We only used Gaussian white noise as the synthetic noise in Sec. 4 to evaluate the denoising performance, because it is the most widely used noise model for testing denoising methods. Please note that in Sec. 5 we used real-world clinical data, in which the noise distribution is unknown, but the proposed approach is still demonstrated effective, as shown by the visual comparison in Fig. 4 and the improved cerebral microbleed (CMB) detection performance in Table 2. Comment: In Table 1, the performance of DnCNN [15] is inferior to BM3D, but literatures (e.g., [15]) have demonstrated that DnCNN is better than BM3D. (R1) Answer: Previous works usually test DnCNN on natural image datasets such as BSD68 [15], on which DnCNN indeed exhibits superior performance. However, such superiority partially relies on the closeness of the training data and the testing data. When the test set is dissimilar with the training set, the trained model may not fit the test data so well. The results in Table 1 indicate that DnCNN may not be well generalized to the medical image datasets like DX and MMM. In contrast, BM3D and the proposed ASAS do not rely on training data and are better at generalization. Comment: Denoised images inevitably lose details. It is not clear why denoising can help detection. (R1) Answer: By pursuing optimal signal-adaptive sparsity, the proposed ASAS strives to preserve the fine details while removing noise. Since the image contents of interest are well preserved and the interference of noise is effectively suppressed (see Fig. 4), the proposed ASAS not only significantly reduces false positives, but also makes the lesions more discernable and thus increases true positives. Besides, when data size is limited, using data with higher quality could improve the performance of the deep learning model. Comment: The improvement of precision should be 5%, rather than 18.03%. (R4) Answer: By saying “ASAS denoising improved the precision by 18.03%” we meant relative improvement, which is calculated by (P_denoised–P_original)/P_original=(0.3286-0.2784)/0.2784=18.03%, while the reviewer considers the absolute improvement, which is P_denoised–P_original=0.3286-0.2784=0.0502. Comment: It’s not clear why there is a point with 0 precision and 0 sensitivity in Fig. 5. (R4) Answer: One of the subjects in the dataset doesn’t have any CMB, hence the corresponding true positive is 0 and both precision and sensitivity were trivially set to 0.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Deep learning for medical image analysis requires large quantities of high-quality imaging data for training purposes, which could be often less available due to ex-istence of heavy noise in particular imaging modalities. This issue is especially obvious in cerebral microbleed (CMB) detection, since CMBs are more discerna-ble on long echo time (TE) susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) data, which are unfortunately much noisier than those with shorter TE. In this paper we present an effective unsupervised image denoising scheme with application to boosting the performance of deep learning based CMB detection. The proposed content-adaptive denoising technique uses the log-determinant of covariance matrices formed by highly correlated image contents retrieved from the input itself to im-plicitly and efficiently exploit sparsity in PCA domain. The numerical solution to the corresponding optimization problem comes down to an adaptive squeeze-and-shrink (ASAS) operation on the underlying PCA coefficients. Obviously, the ASAS denoising does not rely on any external dataset and could be better fit the input image data. Experiments on medical image datasets with synthetic Gaussian white noise demonstrate that the proposed ASAS scheme is highly competitive among state-of-the-art sparsity based approaches as well as deep learning based method. When applied to the deep learning based CMB detection on the real-world TE3 SWI dataset, the proposed ASAS denoising could improve the preci-sion by 18.03%, sensitivity by 7.64%, and increase the correlation between counts of ground truth and automated detection by 19.87%.

      <p>This paper proposed Adaptive Squeeze-and-Shrink Image Denoising method, together with deep network, for detection of cerebral microbleeds. It is shown that the denoising can improve the detection task. The reviewers mostly feel positive and have questions on the non-realistic Gaussian noises, comparison with DnCNN, precision of improvement, etc. The response clearly clarified these points. One remaining question is on the comparisons with SOTA, since in denoising, DnCNN is not SOTA, and many learning-based methods have been proposed in medical image denoising, recently. However, considering that this proposed method is unsupervised and has merits in the framework of traditional denoising framework, the paper can be accepted.</p>

  <p>We thank the reviewers for their efforts in reviewing the paper.</p>

  <p>Comment: 
Since noise in most medical images is not Gaussian, the chosen Gaussian model for the noise should be justified. (R1, Meta-R2)
Answer:
We did not assume the noise to be Gaussian distributed; in fact, the proposed method does not depend on the distribution of noise. We only used Gaussian white noise as the synthetic noise in Sec. 4 to evaluate the denoising performance, because it is the most widely used noise model for testing denoising methods. Please note that in Sec. 5 we used real-world clinical data, in which the noise distribution is unknown, but the proposed approach is still demonstrated effective, as shown by the visual comparison in Fig. 4 and the improved cerebral microbleed (CMB) detection performance in Table 2.</p>

  <p>Comment: 
In Table 1, the performance of DnCNN [15] is inferior to BM3D, but literatures (e.g., [15]) have demonstrated that DnCNN is better than BM3D. (R1)
Answer: 
Previous works usually test DnCNN on natural image datasets such as BSD68 [15], on which DnCNN indeed exhibits superior performance. However, such superiority partially relies on the closeness of the training data and the testing data. When the test set is dissimilar with the training set, the trained model may not fit the test data so well. The results in Table 1 indicate that DnCNN may not be well generalized to the medical image datasets like DX and MMM. In contrast, BM3D and the proposed ASAS do not rely on training data and are better at generalization.</p>

  <p>Comment:
Denoised images inevitably lose details. It is not clear why denoising can help detection. (R1)
Answer:
By pursuing optimal signal-adaptive sparsity, the proposed ASAS strives to preserve the fine details while removing noise. Since the image contents of interest are well preserved and the interference of noise is effectively suppressed (see Fig. 4), the proposed ASAS not only significantly reduces false positives, but also makes the lesions more discernable and thus increases true positives. Besides, when data size is limited, using data with higher quality could improve the performance of the deep learning model.</p>

  <p>Comment:
The improvement of precision should be 5%, rather than 18.03%. (R4)
Answer:
By saying “ASAS denoising improved the precision by 18.03%” we meant relative improvement, which is calculated by (P_denoised–P_original)/P_original=(0.3286-0.2784)/0.2784=18.03%, while the reviewer considers the absolute improvement, which is P_denoised–P_original=0.3286-0.2784=0.0502.</p>

  <p>Comment:
It’s not clear why there is a point with 0 precision and 0 sensitivity in Fig. 5. (R4)
Answer:
One of the subjects in the dataset doesn’t have any CMB, hence the corresponding true positive is 0 and both precision and sensitivity were trivially set to 0.</p>

  <p>Comment:
The author should better clarify the contributions of their work. (Meta-R2)
Answer:
We combined a novel unsupervised denoising scheme ASAS and a deep learning model to tackle the challenging problem of CMB detection. The proposed ASAS achieves signal-adaptive sparsity without explicit dictionary training. We revealed that ASAS essentially applies adaptive squeeze-and-shrink operations to the eigenvalues. When tested on real-world clinical data, ASAS significantly improved the performance of the deep neural network for CMB detection.</p>

  <p>Comment:
The compared methods are not the most recent ones. (R1, R4)
Answer:
We used BM3D [7], CSR [9] and DnCNN [15] for comparison, considering that BM3D is the most widely-used benchmark for denoising in recent years, CSR is a typical and successful sparsity based method and is in the same category as the proposed ASAS, and DnCNN is a representative deep learning based denoising method. Table 1 shows that ASAS is highly competitive.</p>

  <p>Comment:
In Sec. 2.2: The left side equation is wrong though the right side one is true. This is easy to solve. (R2)
Answer:
We thank the reviewer for the kind reminder. We’ll correct the typo.</p>
