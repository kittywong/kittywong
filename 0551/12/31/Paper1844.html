<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Lisette Lockhart, Parvaneh Saeedi, Jason Au, Jon Havelock Abstract In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment is increasingly chosen by couples suffering from infertility as a means to conceive. Time-lapse imaging technology has enabled continuous monitoring of embryos in vitro and time-based development metrics for assessing embryo quality prior to transfer. Timing at which embryos reach certain development stages provides valuable information about their potential to become a positive pregnancy. Automating development stage detection of day 4-5 embryos remains difficult due to small variation between stages. In this paper, a classifier is trained to detect embryo development stage with learning strategies added to explicitly address challenges of this task. Synergic loss encourages the network to recognize and utilize stage similarities between different embryos. Short-range temporal learning incorporates chronological order to embryo sequence predictions. Image and sequence augmentations complement both approaches to increase generalization to unseen sequences. The proposed approach was applied to human embryo sequences with labeled morula and blastocyst stage onsets. Morula and blastocyst stage classification was improved by 5.71% and 1.11%, respectively, while morula and blastocyst stage mean absolute onset error was reduced by 19.1% and 8.7%, respectively.

The authors use: -Synergic loss to provides feedback to learning of embryo-independent stage similarities -Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers add temporal context to image stage classi cation -Image and sequence training augmentations promote generalization to un- seen embryo sequences. They applied the method to human embryo sequences with labeled morula and blastocyst stage onsets. Morula and blastocyst stage classi cation was improved, while morula and blastocyst stage mean absolute onset error was reduced. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. This is a valid problem. The solution is reasonable and validated. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Explain while they select to use synergic loss for stage similarities. The stages they identify are very few.

What is the ranking of this paper in your review stack? 1 Number of papers in your stack 5 Reviewer confidence Very confident Review #2 Please describe the contribution of the paper This paper presents a computational approach to classify developmental stages in time-lapse videos of embryos as quality control for IVF. The main difficulty of this task is the typical small variability of features between stages and the often high variability across experiments. The authors address this problem by introducing a synergic loss, an LSTM sequence model and dedicated augmentations to a deep learning network classifier. These additions considerably improved the model performance compared to the intrinsic basline. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. I think the main strength of the paper is the idea to include the parallel input streams with the synergic loss in combination with a refinement via LSTM. This approach seems to be very promising for in a more general context (staging of microscopy time-lapse experiments in general.). I also like the step-wise validation of the different parts of the method. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The main weakness in my opinion is lack of clarity in motivating or explaining the different parts of the model. E.g. it would be good to give the reasons why the synergic loss approach was chosen and what the expectation was, the explanation of the post-processing of the predictions was not clear to me A minor but still important point: I think the paper should also come with the source code, otherwise it would be hard to rebuild such a system for e.g. a different application. It seems like the authors do not plan to publish the code. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance There is no code available it seems. I think this is limiting the reproducibility of the paper. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html I do like the paper in priniciple. Overall it is well structured. I found some details in the text a bit confusing and sometimes I think crucial explanations are missing: major: In 3.1. the description of the synergic network requires an explanation I think. It would be good to know what the intuition is behind this choice. Even a single sentence would be helpful to make the paper self-contained. In my opinion 3.3. does not contain enough information to understand and reproduce the optimization of stage predictions. An explanation, an additional panel in figure 2 or a small example would be very helpful. minor: The presentation of the related work on p2 was a bit confusing. Maybe this could be given a clearer structure or order. “Embryo staging of embryonic cleavage times and morula through expanded blastocyst stage onset was ﬁrst performed using image processing techniques [9].” I am not sure that this reference is really the first paper to use image processing for embryo staging. Shouldn’t there be an earlier reference, or maybe the phrase “image processing for embryo staging” is meant in a more narrow sense here. I found the explanation of the oversampling approach on p5 (top paragraph) a bit confusing. After reading the paper I kind of understood what was meant here, but maybe you can rewrite this part and include a little bit more explanation to make it clearer. Please state your overall opinion of the paper Probably accept (7) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? In principle I find it a good paper that describes an interesting approach to stage prediction from time-lapse data. I think it can be of interest to a lot of people working outside of IVF as well. But it would certainly improve this contribution considerably to provide some more explanations and intuitions and also make the actual implementation available.

To facilitate in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, this paper proposes a classification method to predict the development stage of embryos from time-lapse imaging data using synergic loss and temporal learning. Experimental results on human embryo sequences with labeled morula and blastocyst stage onsets are promising. The reviewer recommendations are mixed. Overall the work is interesting and addresses an important problem. There is concern about the novelty of the network model used and the lack of comparison with other works. However, as the authors point out, there is little previous work to compare with and no public data sets are available. With the promised revisions I believe the paper is acceptable for MICCAI 2021.

To facilitate further research and development, we have published the source code and will include a GitHub link in the final paper version. Rev. #2 and Rev. #4: Synergic loss intuition We agree the use of synergic loss was not motivated in the paper and will revise it for clarity. Synergic loss was chosen because it explicitly encourages all pairs of encoded features from the same stage to be similar. Encoded features from different stages are discouraged from being similar. Since embryos vary considerably throughout each stage but vary little near stage onsets, synergic loss was expected to improve the network’s ability to encode features that can better distinguish between stages. Rev. #2 and #5: Embryo transfer While selecting the best embryo for transfer is the end goal in a clinical setting, we argue that automating stage onset detection is important and may enable future innovations and research opportunities, as noted by Rev. #4. It can improve embryologists’ workflow for selecting implantation embryos by removing the need for manual stage onset detection. As noted by Rev. #5, image recognition methods are becoming more prevalent IVF clinics. Predicting development stage onset to assist with embryo selection is more interpretable and could be adopted into clinical practice easier than an algorithm that predicts embryo implantation directly. Rev. #6 and Meta-Rev #2: Comparison with other works Directly comparing our work with others on the same dataset for the same task is ideal. However, there is no publicly available dataset to use for comparison. Previous works [Leahy et al., 2020 and Feyeux et al., 2020] do not have the same embryo stages and contain significantly different amounts of training and test sequences, so comparing reported performance would not be informative. Single CNN performance is provided as baseline (top row of Tables 2 and 3). This single CNN baseline is similar to the “Single Focus” method used in [Leahy et al., 2020] with VGG16 instead of NesNeXt101 (which we found empirically was a stronger baseline for our staging task and dataset). It is not possible to re-implement their highest performing “Full Setting” on our dataset since this method uses multiple focal planes as network input and our dataset has only a single focal plane available. We did not include results for all combinations of the methods due to page limits. Rev. #4: Explanation of post-processing We acknowledge this paragraph could be confusing and could be re-phrased as follows: Embryo stage is clinically defined to be monotonic non-decreasing across any time-lapse sequence. The network output stage predictions can oscillate between stages and are therefore restructured to enforce monotonic non-decreasing order. Each sequence is restructured by selecting the monotonic non-decreasing series of stage classifications that has lowest error with the network output stage classification predictions. The loss (NLL or MAE) is computed for each frame and summed across the sequence. For a sequence of length N, all possible monotonic non-decreasing stage classifications are: $\forall (i \in [2, N-1], j \in [3, N] j &gt; i)$, where $i$ and $j$ are morula and blastocyst stage onset frame, respectively. Stage onset is then selected from the minimum restructured sequence index at which that stage was predicted. back to top" />

To facilitate further research and development, we have published the source code and will include a GitHub link in the final paper version. Rev. #2 and Rev. #4: Synergic loss intuition We agree the use of synergic loss was not motivated in the paper and will revise it for clarity. Synergic loss was chosen because it explicitly encourages all pairs of encoded features from the same stage to be similar. Encoded features from different stages are discouraged from being similar. Since embryos vary considerably throughout each stage but vary little near stage onsets, synergic loss was expected to improve the network’s ability to encode features that can better distinguish between stages. Rev. #2 and #5: Embryo transfer While selecting the best embryo for transfer is the end goal in a clinical setting, we argue that automating stage onset detection is important and may enable future innovations and research opportunities, as noted by Rev. #4. It can improve embryologists’ workflow for selecting implantation embryos by removing the need for manual stage onset detection. As noted by Rev. #5, image recognition methods are becoming more prevalent IVF clinics. Predicting development stage onset to assist with embryo selection is more interpretable and could be adopted into clinical practice easier than an algorithm that predicts embryo implantation directly. Rev. #6 and Meta-Rev #2: Comparison with other works Directly comparing our work with others on the same dataset for the same task is ideal. However, there is no publicly available dataset to use for comparison. Previous works [Leahy et al., 2020 and Feyeux et al., 2020] do not have the same embryo stages and contain significantly different amounts of training and test sequences, so comparing reported performance would not be informative. Single CNN performance is provided as baseline (top row of Tables 2 and 3). This single CNN baseline is similar to the “Single Focus” method used in [Leahy et al., 2020] with VGG16 instead of NesNeXt101 (which we found empirically was a stronger baseline for our staging task and dataset). It is not possible to re-implement their highest performing “Full Setting” on our dataset since this method uses multiple focal planes as network input and our dataset has only a single focal plane available. We did not include results for all combinations of the methods due to page limits. Rev. #4: Explanation of post-processing We acknowledge this paragraph could be confusing and could be re-phrased as follows: Embryo stage is clinically defined to be monotonic non-decreasing across any time-lapse sequence. The network output stage predictions can oscillate between stages and are therefore restructured to enforce monotonic non-decreasing order. Each sequence is restructured by selecting the monotonic non-decreasing series of stage classifications that has lowest error with the network output stage classification predictions. The loss (NLL or MAE) is computed for each frame and summed across the sequence. For a sequence of length N, all possible monotonic non-decreasing stage classifications are: $\forall (i \in [2, N-1], j \in [3, N] j &gt; i)$, where $i$ and $j$ are morula and blastocyst stage onset frame, respectively. Stage onset is then selected from the minimum restructured sequence index at which that stage was predicted. back to top" />

Time-lapse imaging technology has enabled continuous monitoring of embryos in vitro and time-based development metrics for assessing embryo quality prior to transfer. Timing at which embryos reach certain development stages provides valuable information about their potential to become a positive pregnancy. Automating development stage detection of day 4-5 embryos remains difficult due to small variation between stages. In this paper, a classifier is trained to detect embryo development stage with learning strategies added to explicitly address challenges of this task. Synergic loss encourages the network to recognize and utilize stage similarities between different embryos. Short-range temporal learning incorporates chronological order to embryo sequence predictions. Image and sequence augmentations complement both approaches to increase generalization to unseen sequences. The proposed approach was applied to human embryo sequences with labeled morula and blastocyst stage onsets. Morula and blastocyst stage classification was improved by 5.71% and 1.11%, respectively, while morula and blastocyst stage mean absolute onset error was reduced by 19.1% and 8.7%, respectively.

The authors use: -Synergic loss to provides feedback to learning of embryo-independent stage similarities -Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers add temporal context to image stage classi cation -Image and sequence training augmentations promote generalization to un- seen embryo sequences. They applied the method to human embryo sequences with labeled morula and blastocyst stage onsets. Morula and blastocyst stage classi cation was improved, while morula and blastocyst stage mean absolute onset error was reduced. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. This is a valid problem. The solution is reasonable and validated. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Explain while they select to use synergic loss for stage similarities. The stages they identify are very few. Perhaps a simpler markov chain would be sufficient with fewer parameters than sequential neural networks. Argue that multiparameter neural networks are necessary. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Very Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance They provide a diagram to explain their neural network that is helpful. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html Justify why you select this methodology. You do not explicitly link the stages that you are modeling with the best timing for embryo transfer. Please state your overall opinion of the paper strong accept (9) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? This is a valid problem with a valid and evaluated solution. What is the ranking of this paper in your review stack? 1 Number of papers in your stack 5 Reviewer confidence Very confident Review #2 Please describe the contribution of the paper This paper presents a computational approach to classify developmental stages in time-lapse videos of embryos as quality control for IVF. The main difficulty of this task is the typical small variability of features between stages and the often high variability across experiments. The authors address this problem by introducing a synergic loss, an LSTM sequence model and dedicated augmentations to a deep learning network classifier. These additions considerably improved the model performance compared to the intrinsic basline. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. I think the main strength of the paper is the idea to include the parallel input streams with the synergic loss in combination with a refinement via LSTM. This approach seems to be very promising for in a more general context (staging of microscopy time-lapse experiments in general.). I also like the step-wise validation of the different parts of the method. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The main weakness in my opinion is lack of clarity in motivating or explaining the different parts of the model. E.g. it would be good to give the reasons why the synergic loss approach was chosen and what the expectation was, the explanation of the post-processing of the predictions was not clear to me A minor but still important point: I think the paper should also come with the source code, otherwise it would be hard to rebuild such a system for e.g. a different application. It seems like the authors do not plan to publish the code. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance There is no code available it seems. I think this is limiting the reproducibility of the paper. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html I do like the paper in priniciple. Overall it is well structured. I found some details in the text a bit confusing and sometimes I think crucial explanations are missing: major: In 3.1. the description of the synergic network requires an explanation I think. It would be good to know what the intuition is behind this choice. Even a single sentence would be helpful to make the paper self-contained. In my opinion 3.3. does not contain enough information to understand and reproduce the optimization of stage predictions. An explanation, an additional panel in figure 2 or a small example would be very helpful. minor: The presentation of the related work on p2 was a bit confusing. Maybe this could be given a clearer structure or order. “Embryo staging of embryonic cleavage times and morula through expanded blastocyst stage onset was ﬁrst performed using image processing techniques [9].” I am not sure that this reference is really the first paper to use image processing for embryo staging. Shouldn’t there be an earlier reference, or maybe the phrase “image processing for embryo staging” is meant in a more narrow sense here. I found the explanation of the oversampling approach on p5 (top paragraph) a bit confusing. After reading the paper I kind of understood what was meant here, but maybe you can rewrite this part and include a little bit more explanation to make it clearer. Please state your overall opinion of the paper Probably accept (7) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? In principle I find it a good paper that describes an interesting approach to stage prediction from time-lapse data. I think it can be of interest to a lot of people working outside of IVF as well. But it would certainly improve this contribution considerably to provide some more explanations and intuitions and also make the actual implementation available.

Morula and blastocyst stage onset prediction based on the image processing and recognition technology is increasingly used in IVF clinic.

Automating embryo development stage detection based on deep network is innovative. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The main work of this paper is to apply deep learning to the evaluation of embryo transfer potential. However, the network model itself is less innovative.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment is increasingly chosen by couples suffering from infertility as a means to conceive. Time-lapse imaging technology has enabled continuous monitoring of embryos in vitro and time-based development metrics for assessing embryo quality prior to transfer. Timing at which embryos reach certain development stages provides valuable information about their potential to become a positive pregnancy. Automating development stage detection of day 4-5 embryos remains difficult due to small variation between stages. In this paper, a classifier is trained to detect embryo development stage with learning strategies added to explicitly address challenges of this task. Synergic loss encourages the network to recognize and utilize stage similarities between different embryos. Short-range temporal learning incorporates chronological order to embryo sequence predictions. Image and sequence augmentations complement both approaches to increase generalization to unseen sequences. The proposed approach was applied to human embryo sequences with labeled morula and blastocyst stage onsets. Morula and blastocyst stage classification was improved by 5.71% and 1.11%, respectively, while morula and blastocyst stage mean absolute onset error was reduced by 19.1% and 8.7%, respectively. Code is available: https://github.com/llockhar/Embryo-Stage-Onset-Detection.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment can benefit from the timing at which embryos reach certain development stages for their potential to become a positive pregnancy. The authors use: 
-Synergic loss to provides feedback to learning of embryo-independent
stage similarities
-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  layers add temporal context to image
stage classication
-Image and sequence training augmentations promote generalization to un-
seen embryo sequences.
They applied the method to human embryo sequences with labeled morula and blastocyst stage onsets. Morula and blastocyst stage classication was improved, while morula and blastocyst stage mean absolute onset error was reduced.</p>

The stages they identify are very few. Perhaps a simpler markov chain would be sufficient with fewer parameters than sequential neural networks. Argue that multiparameter neural networks are necessary.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This paper presents a computational approach to classify developmental stages in time-lapse videos of embryos as quality control for IVF. The main difficulty of this task is the typical small variability of features between stages and the often high variability across experiments. The authors address this problem by introducing a synergic loss, an LSTM sequence model and dedicated augmentations to a deep learning network classifier. These additions considerably improved the model performance compared to the intrinsic basline.</p>
    </blockquote>

Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I think the main strength of the paper is the idea to include the parallel input streams with the synergic loss in combination with a refinement via LSTM. This approach seems to be very promising for in a more general context (staging of microscopy time-lapse experiments in general.).</p>

      <p>I also like the step-wise validation of the different parts of the method.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The main weakness in my opinion is lack of clarity in motivating or explaining the different parts of the model. E.g.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>it would be good to give the reasons why the synergic loss approach was chosen and what the expectation was,</li>
        <li>the explanation of the post-processing of the predictions was not clear to me</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A minor but still important point: I think the paper should also come with the source code, otherwise it would be hard to rebuild such a system for e.g. a different application. It seems like the authors do not plan to publish the code.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I do like the paper in priniciple. Overall it is well structured.
I found some details in the text a bit confusing and sometimes I think crucial explanations are missing:</p>

      <p>major:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In 3.1. the description of the synergic network requires an explanation I think. It would be good to know what the intuition is behind this choice. Even a single sentence would be helpful to make the paper self-contained.</li>
        <li>In my opinion 3.3. does not contain enough information to understand and reproduce the optimization of stage predictions. An explanation, an additional panel in figure 2 or a small example would be very helpful.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>minor:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The presentation of the related work on p2 was a bit confusing. Maybe this could be given a clearer structure or order.</li>
        <li>“Embryo staging of embryonic cleavage times and morula through expanded blastocyst stage onset was ﬁrst performed using image processing techniques [9].” I am not sure that this reference is really the first paper to use image processing for embryo staging. Shouldn’t there be an earlier reference, or maybe the phrase “image processing for embryo staging” is meant in a more narrow sense here.</li>
        <li>I found the explanation of the oversampling approach on p5 (top paragraph) a bit confusing. After reading the paper I kind of understood what was meant here, but maybe you can rewrite this part and include a little bit more explanation to make it clearer.</li>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In principle I find it a good paper that describes an interesting approach to stage prediction from time-lapse data. I think it can be of interest to a lot of people working outside of IVF as well. But it would certainly improve this contribution considerably to provide some more explanations and intuitions and also make the actual implementation available.</p>

      <p>To facilitate in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, this paper proposes a classification method to predict the development stage of embryos from time-lapse imaging data using synergic loss and temporal learning. Experimental results on human embryo sequences with labeled morula and blastocyst stage onsets are promising. The reviewer recommendations are mixed. Overall the work is interesting and addresses an important problem. There is concern about the novelty of the network model used and the lack of comparison with other works. However, as the authors point out, there is little previous work to compare with and no public data sets are available. With the promised revisions I believe the paper is acceptable for MICCAI 2021.</p>

  <p>We thank all the reviewers for their feedback and interest in the importance of our work, which we agree “seems to be very promising in a more general context” [Rev. #4]. To facilitate further research and development, we have published the source code and will include a GitHub link in the final paper version.</p>

  <p>Rev. #2 and Rev. #4: Synergic loss intuition</p>

  <p>We agree the use of synergic loss was not motivated in the paper and will revise it for clarity. Synergic loss was chosen because it explicitly encourages all pairs of encoded features from the same stage to be similar. Encoded features from different stages are discouraged from being similar. Since embryos vary considerably throughout each stage but vary little near stage onsets, synergic loss was expected to improve the network’s ability to encode features that can better distinguish between stages.</p>

  <p>Rev. #2 and #5: Embryo transfer</p>

  <p>While selecting the best embryo for transfer is the end goal in a clinical setting, we argue that automating stage onset detection is important and may enable future innovations and research opportunities, as noted by Rev. #4. It can improve embryologists’ workflow for selecting implantation embryos by removing the need for manual stage onset detection. As noted by Rev. #5, image recognition methods are becoming more prevalent IVF clinics. Predicting development stage onset to assist with embryo selection is more interpretable and could be adopted into clinical practice easier than an algorithm that predicts embryo implantation directly.</p>

  <p>Rev. #6 and Meta-Rev #2: Comparison with other works</p>

  <p>Directly comparing our work with others on the same dataset for the same task is ideal. However, there is no publicly available dataset to use for comparison. Previous works [Leahy et al., 2020 and Feyeux et al., 2020] do not have the same embryo stages and contain significantly different amounts of training and test sequences, so comparing reported performance would not be informative.</p>

  <p>Single CNN performance is provided as baseline (top row of Tables 2 and 3). This single CNN baseline is similar to the “Single Focus” method used in [Leahy et al., 2020] with VGG16 instead of NesNeXt101 (which we found empirically was a stronger baseline for our staging task and dataset). It is not possible to re-implement their highest performing “Full Setting” on our dataset since this method uses multiple focal planes as network input and our dataset has only a single focal plane available. We did not include results for all combinations of the methods due to page limits.</p>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>We acknowledge this paragraph could be confusing and could be re-phrased as follows: Embryo stage is clinically defined to be monotonic non-decreasing across any time-lapse sequence. The network output stage predictions can oscillate between stages and are therefore restructured to enforce monotonic non-decreasing order. Each sequence is restructured by selecting the monotonic non-decreasing series of stage classifications that has lowest error with the network output stage classification predictions. The loss (NLL or MAE) is computed for each frame and summed across the sequence. For a sequence of length N, all possible monotonic non-decreasing stage classifications are: $\forall (i \in [2, N-1], j \in [3, N]</td>
        <td>j &gt; i)$, where $i$ and $j$ are morula and blastocyst stage onset frame, respectively. Stage onset is then selected from the minimum restructured sequence index at which that stage was predicted.</td>
