<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Peng Wan, Chunrui Liu, Fang Chen, Jing Qin, Daoqiang Zhang Abstract Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been one of the most promising imaging techniques in tumor differential diagnosis since the real-time view of intra-tumor blood microcirculation. Existing studies primarily focus on extracting those discriminative imaging features whereas lack medical explanations. However, accurate quantitation of some clinical experience-driven indexes regarding intra-tumor vascularity, such as tumor infiltration and heterogeneity, still faces significant limitations. To tackle this problem, we present a novel scheme to identify quantitative and explanatory tumor indexes from dynamic CEUS sequences. Specifically, our method mainly comprises three steps: 1) extracting the stable pixel-level perfusion pattern from dynamic CEUS imaging using an improved stable principal component pursuit (SPCP) algorithm; 2) performing local perfusion variation comparison by the proposed Phase-constrained Wasserstein (PCW) distance; 3) estimating three clinical knowledge-induced tumor indexes, i.e. infiltration, regularity, and heterogeneity. The effectiveness of this method was evaluated on our collected CEUS dataset of thyroid nodules, and the resulting infiltration and heterogeneity index with p &lt; 0.05 between different pathological types validated the efficacy of this quantitation scheme in thyroid nodule diagnosis.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been one of the most promising imaging techniques in tumor differential diagnosis since the real-time view of intra-tumor blood microcirculation.  Existing studies primarily focus on extracting those discriminative imaging features whereas lack medical explanations. However, accurate quantitation of some clinical experience-driven indexes regarding intra-tumor vascularity, such as tumor infiltration and heterogeneity, still faces significant limitations. To tackle this problem, we present a novel scheme to identify quantitative and explanatory tumor indexes from dynamic CEUS sequences. Specifically, our method mainly comprises three steps: 1) extracting the stable pixel-level perfusion pattern from dynamic CEUS imaging using an improved stable principal component pursuit (SPCP) algorithm; 2) performing local perfusion variation comparison by the proposed Phase-constrained Wasserstein (PCW) distance; 3) estimating three clinical knowledge-induced tumor indexes, i.e. infiltration, regularity, and heterogeneity. The effectiveness of this method was evaluated on our collected CEUS dataset of thyroid nodules, and the resulting infiltration and heterogeneity index with p &lt; 0.05 between different pathological types validated the efficacy of this quantitation scheme in thyroid nodule diagnosis.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A method to quantify dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) images with is proposed. Three new measures are derived from the acquired signal on a pixel-by-pixel and analyzed for their usefulness as tumor indexes (tumor infiltration, shape regularity, and perfusion heterogeneity). The method is applied to the data acquired from 55 subjects with three pathological types of thyroid nodules showing some of the indexes can discriminate benign from malignant.</p>

Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This paper has the following strengths:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quantitative measures from CEUS, including novel algorithms to extract stable perfusion pattern to account for irregular microbubble destruction leading to inconsistent intensity changes.</li>
        <li>Use of phase-constrained Wasserstein distance for perfusion pattern analysis.</li>

      <p>Some weaknesses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>(minor) Some more details about the dataset could have been included (US equipment/vendor; same or different operators; acquisition parameters)</li>
        <li>(trivial) Need to define which of the three pathological types made up the benign and malignant classes.</li>
        <li>(minor) boxplots are presented for showing tumor indexes between three types but no statistical comparisons (though the boxplots seem to imply no statistically significant differences).</li>

      <p>Here are my comments/questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What does the abbreviation AUC stand for? is it area under the perfusion curve?</li>
        <li>I would be beneficial to compare the performance of the proposed method with other approached for tumor classification such as quantitative ultrasound, electrography, etc.</li>
        <li>It is necessary to investigate the distribution of your data. Are the data normally distributed? The corresponding test has to be completed before running t-test. I am not sure whether your result are valid or not.</li>
        <li>Details regarding your imaging settings such as transmit center frequency, sampling frequency, imaging technique, etc are missing.</li>
        <li>More information regarding the preprocessing steps that you have applied on the original Bmode images helps readers to better understand your method. The current explanation is vague.</li>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The paper proposes a novel scheme for quantitative evaluation of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Generally, the paper touches base on an interesting topic to the medical image computing, and there is a consensus among all reviewers about the novelty, clarity and merits, of the presented work. The paper is also well-organized and easy to follow. A few comments and suggestions related to datasets details and experiments settings (for reproducibility) should be addressed in the camera-ready version. Please add summary of the quantitative results to the abstract. I also agree with R3 to include a feature-domain visualization for the extracted index as well as a comparison with other approaches for tumor classification such as quantitative ultrasound. Please also define abbreviation (e.g., AUC)</p>
