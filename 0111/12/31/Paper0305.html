<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Xiaoqi Zhao, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu Abstract More than 90\% of colorectal cancer is gradually transformed from colorectal polyps. In clinical practice, precise polyp segmentation provides important information in the early detection of colorectal cancer. Therefore, automatic polyp segmentation techniques are of great importance for both patients and doctors. Most existing methods are based on U-shape structure and use element-wise addition or concatenation to fuse different level features progressively in decoder. However, both the two operations easily generate plenty of redundant information, which will weaken the complementarity between different level features, resulting in inaccurate localization and blurred edges of polyps. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-scale subtraction network (MSNet) to segment polyp from colonoscopy image. Specifically, we first design a subtraction unit (SU) to produce the difference features between adjacent levels in encoder. Then, we pyramidally equip the SUs at different levels with varying receptive fields, thereby obtaining rich multi-scale difference information. In addition, we build a training-free network ``LossNet’’ to comprehensively supervise the polyp-aware features from bottom layer to top layer, which drives the MSNet to capture the detailed and structural cues simultaneously. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our MSNet performs favorably against most state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics. Furthermore, MSNet runs at a real-time speed of $\sim$70fps when processing a $352 \times 352$ image. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/MSNet.

Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. Good organization of the paper, easy to read. Extensive experiment with ablation studies and comparison to other methods Promising real-time performance for clinical applications. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Subtraction definition looks interesting, but lack of mathematical explanation. It similar to a ResNet block, which replace + to - with some minor changes. As a consequence, it is difficult to find the difference between subtraction unit and ResBlock. Author should include more discussion of this. Concept of LossNet is applied in many applications, and received successful results, also in this paper. But without any fine-tuning, the pre-train ImageNet parameters might have different input domain, i.e. segmentation binary domain v.s. nature RGB domain. I am not sure author’s approach is reasonable. In addition, the L2 distance might not be the optimal metric, as the feature space is a more complex manifold rather than a standard Euclidean space.

Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. If I understand correctly, the authors use Kvasir and CVC-ClinicDB datasets for training and other datasets as testing.

Considering the quantitative results, the proposed method seems not significantly better PraNet on Kvasir, CVC-T and CVC-ClinicDB. Thus, it looks like a better domain generalization performance on unseen domains, which is not the main goal of this network. This is not discussed. The claimed contribution about LossNet is not convincing. For me, it is very similar to style loss or perceptual loss, which is commonly used in tasks including style transfer, inpainting, etc. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Excellent Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper.

Below we answer some key questions. Q1:The motivation and novelty of subtraction unit. A: We indeed use the subtraction unit (SU) to replace the element-wise addition to fuse different scale features. The SU computes the absolute difference of its two input features. In the multi-scale subtraction module, the horizontal cascade of SUs can continually compute the differential features between adjacent scales, and then they are added to the main-scale feature. Just because of the subtraction operation, the resulted features input to the decoder have much less redundancy among different levels and their scale-specific properties are significantly enhanced. Thus, in the decoder, the interference of different levels is weakened and the task-aware region can be more easily attended. While the addition operation makes the feature of each scale fed into the decoder cover the information of two scales (itself and its deeper neighbor), which results in that the decoder needs to handle very redundant features. In addition, the SUs actually build a constraint to extract the multi-level separable information, which helps the network converge faster and better. We replace all SUs with the element-wise addition units and compare their performance on all five datasets. Our MSNet achieves the average gains of 4.43%; 9.19%; 5.05%; 2.10%; 2.27%; 20.07% in terms of mDice, mIoU, wFm, Sm, Em and MAE. The significant improvement further shows that the SU is a very solid contribution. The experimental results on different datasets are listed as follows: ColonDB (mDice: 0.697 vs 0.755, mIoU: 0.630 vs 0.807, wFm:0.676 vs 0.737, Sm: 0.811 vs 0.836, Em:0.839 vs 0.883, MAE:0.055 vs 0.041), ETIS (mDice: 0.680 vs 0.719, mIoU: 0.621 vs 0.664, wFm:0.636 vs 0.678, Sm: 0.817 vs 0.840, Em:0.820 vs 0.830, MAE:0.020 vs 0.020), Kvasir (mDice: 0.872 vs 0.907, mIoU: 0.815 vs 0.862,wFm:0.853 vs 0.893, Sm: 0.897 vs 0.922, Em:0.929 vs 0.944, MAE:0.039 vs 0.028), CVC-T (mDice: 0.868 vs 0.869, mIoU: 0.803 vs 0.807,wFm:0.846 vs 0.849, Sm: 0.921 vs 0.925, Em:0.940 vs 0.943, MAE:0.010 vs 0.010), ClinicDB (mDice: 0.886 vs 0.921, mIoU: 0.840 vs 0.879,wFm:0.874 vs 0.914, Sm: 0.928 vs 0.941, Em:0.944 vs 0.972, MAE:0.015 vs 0.008). Q2:The motivaiton and novelty of LossNet. A:LossNet is similar in form to perception loss. Our motivation is different from its. Using LossNet can get rid of the manual and complex design of the loss function. Moreover, high segmentation accuracy is required for the body as well as the contour of the lesion. Because the inputs are binary segmentation masks, LossNet can directly target the geometric features of the lesion and perform joint supervisions from the contour to the body, thereby improving the overall segmentation accuracy. In Fig. 3, the visualized feature maps qualitatively reveal the rationality of our application of LossNet, that is, it can implement the detail-to-structure supervision in the feature levels. In Table 3, it can be seen that LossNet does lead to an important performance improvement. While in the style transfer and inpainting tasks, the perception-like loss is mainly used to speed the convergence of GAN and obtain high frequency information and ease checkerboard artifacts, but it does not bring obvious accuracy improvement. Reviewers have also stated that multiple papers in multiple tasks have used the perception-like loss, but in the binary segmentation task, this work is the first one. back to top" />

Below we answer some key questions. Q1:The motivation and novelty of subtraction unit. A: We indeed use the subtraction unit (SU) to replace the element-wise addition to fuse different scale features. The SU computes the absolute difference of its two input features. In the multi-scale subtraction module, the horizontal cascade of SUs can continually compute the differential features between adjacent scales, and then they are added to the main-scale feature. Just because of the subtraction operation, the resulted features input to the decoder have much less redundancy among different levels and their scale-specific properties are significantly enhanced. Thus, in the decoder, the interference of different levels is weakened and the task-aware region can be more easily attended. While the addition operation makes the feature of each scale fed into the decoder cover the information of two scales (itself and its deeper neighbor), which results in that the decoder needs to handle very redundant features. In addition, the SUs actually build a constraint to extract the multi-level separable information, which helps the network converge faster and better. We replace all SUs with the element-wise addition units and compare their performance on all five datasets. Our MSNet achieves the average gains of 4.43%; 9.19%; 5.05%; 2.10%; 2.27%; 20.07% in terms of mDice, mIoU, wFm, Sm, Em and MAE. The significant improvement further shows that the SU is a very solid contribution. The experimental results on different datasets are listed as follows: ColonDB (mDice: 0.697 vs 0.755, mIoU: 0.630 vs 0.807, wFm:0.676 vs 0.737, Sm: 0.811 vs 0.836, Em:0.839 vs 0.883, MAE:0.055 vs 0.041), ETIS (mDice: 0.680 vs 0.719, mIoU: 0.621 vs 0.664, wFm:0.636 vs 0.678, Sm: 0.817 vs 0.840, Em:0.820 vs 0.830, MAE:0.020 vs 0.020), Kvasir (mDice: 0.872 vs 0.907, mIoU: 0.815 vs 0.862,wFm:0.853 vs 0.893, Sm: 0.897 vs 0.922, Em:0.929 vs 0.944, MAE:0.039 vs 0.028), CVC-T (mDice: 0.868 vs 0.869, mIoU: 0.803 vs 0.807,wFm:0.846 vs 0.849, Sm: 0.921 vs 0.925, Em:0.940 vs 0.943, MAE:0.010 vs 0.010), ClinicDB (mDice: 0.886 vs 0.921, mIoU: 0.840 vs 0.879,wFm:0.874 vs 0.914, Sm: 0.928 vs 0.941, Em:0.944 vs 0.972, MAE:0.015 vs 0.008). Q2:The motivaiton and novelty of LossNet. A:LossNet is similar in form to perception loss. Our motivation is different from its. Using LossNet can get rid of the manual and complex design of the loss function. Moreover, high segmentation accuracy is required for the body as well as the contour of the lesion. Because the inputs are binary segmentation masks, LossNet can directly target the geometric features of the lesion and perform joint supervisions from the contour to the body, thereby improving the overall segmentation accuracy. In Fig. 3, the visualized feature maps qualitatively reveal the rationality of our application of LossNet, that is, it can implement the detail-to-structure supervision in the feature levels. In Table 3, it can be seen that LossNet does lead to an important performance improvement. While in the style transfer and inpainting tasks, the perception-like loss is mainly used to speed the convergence of GAN and obtain high frequency information and ease checkerboard artifacts, but it does not bring obvious accuracy improvement. Reviewers have also stated that multiple papers in multiple tasks have used the perception-like loss, but in the binary segmentation task, this work is the first one. back to top" />

In clinical practice, precise polyp segmentation provides important information in the early detection of colorectal cancer. Therefore, automatic polyp segmentation techniques are of great importance for both patients and doctors. Most existing methods are based on U-shape structure and use element-wise addition or concatenation to fuse different level features progressively in decoder. However, both the two operations easily generate plenty of redundant information, which will weaken the complementarity between different level features, resulting in inaccurate localization and blurred edges of polyps. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-scale subtraction network (MSNet) to segment polyp from colonoscopy image. Specifically, we first design a subtraction unit (SU) to produce the difference features between adjacent levels in encoder. Then, we pyramidally equip the SUs at different levels with varying receptive fields, thereby obtaining rich multi-scale difference information. In addition, we build a training-free network ``LossNet’’ to comprehensively supervise the polyp-aware features from bottom layer to top layer, which drives the MSNet to capture the detailed and structural cues simultaneously. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our MSNet performs favorably against most state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics. Furthermore, MSNet runs at a real-time speed of $\\sim$70fps when processing a $352 \\times 352$ image. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/MSNet.

In addition, a training-free loss network is implemented for contextual level information supervision. Extensive experiments show the proposed method provides higher performance than recent literature. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. Good organization of the paper, easy to read. Extensive experiment with ablation studies and comparison to other methods Promising real-time performance for clinical applications. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Subtraction definition looks interesting, but lack of mathematical explanation. It similar to a ResNet block, which replace + to - with some minor changes. As a consequence, it is difficult to find the difference between subtraction unit and ResBlock. Author should include more discussion of this. Concept of LossNet is applied in many applications, and received successful results, also in this paper. But without any fine-tuning, the pre-train ImageNet parameters might have different input domain, i.e. segmentation binary domain v.s. nature RGB domain. I am not sure author’s approach is reasonable. In addition, the L2 distance might not be the optimal metric, as the feature space is a more complex manifold rather than a standard Euclidean space. Why all the evaluation results are presented by mean without STD? Without STD, it is hard to find the distribution with statistical difference.

A subtraction unit is proposed to extract lower-/higher-order cross-level features. The designed loss function is utilized to optimize the results from both structure and details. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. This paper designs a novel multi-scale subtraction polyp segmentation network combing the higher-order and lower-order features, which is a simple and easy strategy to follow. The experiment section is sufficient since the proposed model is comprehensively investigated and it shows its superiority among other methods. The authors utilize a new training loss to min the structure and details during the backward phase, which is interesting and useful. The overall results are pretty good and achieve real-time speed. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. Motivation of subtraction unit is not clear. The description in the method section only based on the technique motivation but not intuitive motivation. No groundtruth in the fig.1.

What is the ranking of this paper in your review stack? 1 Number of papers in your stack 5 Reviewer confidence Very confident Review #3 Please describe the contribution of the paper The authors present a novel network for polyp segmentation from colonoscopy images. They introduced a subtraction unit to get the difference between features of adjacent levels and apply it at different levels. The network makes quick predictions and presents good results. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The network architecture is interesting: the nested structure reminds me UNet++, while the authors do not perform multi-level supervision. Tables and figures are well presented. The quantitative results tested with different datasets are quite stable, substantially better than others. Ablation study is performed and showed good results. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. If I understand correctly, the authors use Kvasir and CVC-ClinicDB datasets for training and other datasets as testing. In this case, Kvasir and CVC-ClinicDB are considered as source domains, while others are target domains for domain adaptation/generalization. Considering the quantitative results, the proposed method seems not significantly better PraNet on Kvasir, CVC-T and CVC-ClinicDB. Thus, it looks like a better domain generalization performance on unseen domains, which is not the main goal of this network. This is not discussed. The claimed contribution about LossNet is not convincing. For me, it is very similar to style loss or perceptual loss, which is commonly used in tasks including style transfer, inpainting, etc. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Excellent Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The authors claim they will release the code if the paper is accepted, and the datasets they used are public benchmarks, so it would be easy to reproduce their results. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html Add statistical tests for the results.

The significant improvement further shows that the SU is a very solid contribution. The experimental results on different datasets are listed as follows: ColonDB (mDice: 0.697 vs 0.755, mIoU: 0.630 vs 0.807, wFm:0.676 vs 0.737, Sm: 0.811 vs 0.836, Em:0.839 vs 0.883, MAE:0.055 vs 0.041), ETIS (mDice: 0.680 vs 0.719, mIoU: 0.621 vs 0.664, wFm:0.636 vs 0.678, Sm: 0.817 vs 0.840, Em:0.820 vs 0.830, MAE:0.020 vs 0.020), Kvasir (mDice: 0.872 vs 0.907, mIoU: 0.815 vs 0.862,wFm:0.853 vs 0.893, Sm: 0.897 vs 0.922, Em:0.929 vs 0.944, MAE:0.039 vs 0.028), CVC-T (mDice: 0.868 vs 0.869, mIoU: 0.803 vs 0.807,wFm:0.846 vs 0.849, Sm: 0.921 vs 0.925, Em:0.940 vs 0.943, MAE:0.010 vs 0.010), ClinicDB (mDice: 0.886 vs 0.921, mIoU: 0.840 vs 0.879,wFm:0.874 vs 0.914, Sm: 0.928 vs 0.941, Em:0.944 vs 0.972, MAE:0.015 vs 0.008).

While in the style transfer and inpainting tasks, the perception-like loss is mainly used to speed the convergence of GAN and obtain high frequency information and ease checkerboard artifacts, but it does not bring obvious accuracy improvement. Reviewers have also stated that multiple papers in multiple tasks have used the perception-like loss, but in the binary segmentation task, this work is the first one. back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>More than 90\% of colorectal cancer is gradually transformed from colorectal polyps. In clinical practice, precise polyp segmentation provides important information in the early detection of colorectal cancer. Therefore, automatic polyp segmentation techniques are of great importance for both patients and doctors. Most existing methods are based on U-shape structure and use element-wise addition or concatenation to fuse different level features progressively in decoder. However, both the two operations easily generate plenty of redundant information, which will weaken the complementarity between different level features, resulting in inaccurate localization and blurred edges of polyps. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-scale subtraction network (MSNet) to segment polyp from colonoscopy image. Specifically, we first design a subtraction unit (SU) to produce the difference features between adjacent levels in encoder. Then, we pyramidally equip the SUs at different levels with varying receptive fields, thereby obtaining rich multi-scale difference information. In addition,  we build a training-free network ``LossNet’’ to comprehensively supervise the polyp-aware features from bottom layer to top layer, which drives the MSNet to capture the detailed and structural cues simultaneously. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our MSNet performs favorably against most state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics. Furthermore, MSNet runs at a real-time speed of $\sim$70fps when processing a $352 \times 352$ image. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/MSNet.

        <li>Subtraction definition looks interesting, but lack of mathematical explanation. It similar to a ResNet block, which replace + to - with some minor changes. As a consequence, it is difficult to find the difference between subtraction unit and ResBlock. Author should include more discussion of this.</li>
        <li>Concept of LossNet is applied in many applications, and received successful results, also in this paper. But without any fine-tuning, the pre-train ImageNet parameters might have different input domain, i.e. segmentation binary domain v.s. nature RGB domain. I am not sure author’s approach is reasonable. In addition, the L2 distance might not be the optimal metric, as the feature space is a more complex manifold rather than a standard Euclidean space.</li>
        <li>Why all the evaluation results are presented by mean without STD? Without STD, it is hard to find the distribution with statistical difference.</li>

  <p>We thank the reviewers for their helpful comments. Below we answer some key questions.
Q1:The motivation and novelty of subtraction unit.
A: We indeed use the subtraction unit (SU) to replace the element-wise addition to fuse different scale features. The SU computes the absolute difference of its two input features. In the multi-scale subtraction module, the horizontal cascade of SUs can continually compute the differential features between adjacent scales, and then they are added to the main-scale feature. Just because of the subtraction operation, the resulted features input to the decoder have much less redundancy among different levels and their scale-specific properties are significantly enhanced. Thus, in the decoder, the interference of different levels is weakened and the task-aware region can be more easily attended. While the addition operation makes the feature of each scale fed into the decoder cover the information of two scales (itself and its deeper neighbor), which results in that the decoder needs to handle very redundant features. In addition, the SUs actually build a constraint to extract the multi-level separable information, which helps the network converge faster and better. We replace all SUs with the element-wise addition units and compare their performance on all five datasets. Our MSNet achieves the average gains of 4.43%; 9.19%; 5.05%; 2.10%; 2.27%; 20.07% in terms of mDice, mIoU, wFm, Sm, Em and MAE. The significant improvement further shows that the SU is a very solid contribution. The experimental results on different datasets are listed as follows:
ColonDB (mDice: 0.697 vs 0.755, mIoU: 0.630 vs 0.807, wFm:0.676 vs 0.737, Sm: 0.811 vs 0.836, Em:0.839 vs 0.883, MAE:0.055 vs 0.041), 
ETIS (mDice: 0.680 vs 0.719, mIoU: 0.621 vs 0.664, wFm:0.636 vs 0.678, Sm: 0.817 vs 0.840, Em:0.820 vs 0.830, MAE:0.020 vs 0.020), 
Kvasir (mDice: 0.872 vs 0.907, mIoU: 0.815 vs 0.862,wFm:0.853 vs 0.893, Sm: 0.897 vs 0.922, Em:0.929 vs 0.944, MAE:0.039 vs 0.028), 
CVC-T (mDice: 0.868 vs 0.869, mIoU: 0.803 vs 0.807,wFm:0.846 vs 0.849, Sm: 0.921 vs 0.925, Em:0.940 vs 0.943, MAE:0.010 vs 0.010),<br />
ClinicDB (mDice: 0.886 vs 0.921, mIoU: 0.840 vs 0.879,wFm:0.874 vs 0.914, Sm: 0.928 vs 0.941, Em:0.944 vs 0.972, MAE:0.015 vs 0.008).</p>

  <p>Q2:The motivaiton and novelty of LossNet.
A:LossNet is similar in form to perception loss. Our motivation is different from its. Using LossNet can get rid of the manual and complex design of the loss function. Moreover, high segmentation accuracy is required for the body as well as the contour of the lesion. Because  the inputs are binary segmentation masks, LossNet can directly target the geometric features of the lesion and perform joint supervisions from the contour to the body, thereby improving the overall segmentation accuracy. In Fig. 3, the visualized feature maps qualitatively reveal the rationality of our application of LossNet, that is, it can implement the detail-to-structure supervision in the feature levels. In Table 3, it can be seen that LossNet does lead to an important performance improvement. While in the style transfer and inpainting tasks, the perception-like loss is mainly used to speed the convergence of GAN and obtain high frequency information and ease checkerboard artifacts, but it does not bring obvious accuracy improvement. Reviewers have also stated that multiple papers in multiple tasks have used the perception-like loss, but in the binary segmentation task, this work is the first one.</p>
