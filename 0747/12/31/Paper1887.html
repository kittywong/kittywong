<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Yanfu Zhang, Liang Zhan, Shandong Wu, Paul Thompson, Heng Huang Abstract Diffusion MRI-derived brain structural connectomes or brain networks are widely used in brain research. However, constructing brain networks is highly dependent on various tractography algorithms, which leads to difficulties in deciding the optimal view concerning downstream analysis. In this paper, we propose to learn a unified representation for multi-view brain networks. Particularly, we expect the learned representations to convey the information from different views fairly and in a disentangled sense. We achieve the disentanglement via an approach using unsupervised variational graph auto-encoders. We achieve the view-wise fairness, i.e. proportionality, via an alternative training routine. More specifically, we construct an analogy between training the deep network and the network flow problem. Based on the analogy, the fair representations learning is attained via a network scheduling algorithm aware of proportionality. The experimental results demonstrate that the learned representations fit various downstream tasks well. They also show that the proposed approach effectively preserves the proportionality.

As such, Graph Variational Auto-encoder has been utilized to learn the representations with disentanglement and proportionality. Further, they have performed classification for Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s datasets. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. Overall the paper is written and presented properly. The methodology is well explained and understandable. The results are reproducible. The author has also performed the ablation study. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. There is a limited amount of novelty in the work as they have used the existing deep learning technique, i.e., variational graph Auto-encoder. Features visualization of the network is missing, which is essential for showing the learned distinguishable features of normal and patient. Why have authors chosen three graph convolutional layers for the encoder part? They need to justify with proper reasons. The amount of data over which GVAE has been trained very less. How authors overruled overfitting? The comparative results shown in Tables 1, 2 are very close. With less data it’s statistical relevance is questionable.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Diffusion MRI-derived brain structural connectomes or brain networks are widely used in brain research. However, constructing brain networks is highly dependent on various tractography algorithms, which leads to difficulties in deciding the optimal view concerning downstream analysis. In this paper, we propose to learn a unified representation for multi-view brain networks. Particularly, we expect the learned representations to convey the information from different views fairly and in a disentangled sense. We achieve the disentanglement via an approach using unsupervised variational graph auto-encoders. We achieve the view-wise fairness, i.e. proportionality, via an alternative training routine. More specifically, we construct an analogy between training the deep network and the network flow problem. Based on the analogy, the fair representations learning is attained via a network scheduling algorithm aware of proportionality. The experimental results demonstrate that the learned representations fit various downstream tasks well. They also show that the proposed approach effectively preserves the proportionality.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In this paper, the authors present an unsupervised approach to learn unified graph embeddings for multi-view brain networks. As such, Graph Variational Auto-encoder has been utilized to learn the representations with disentanglement and proportionality. Further, they have performed classification for Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s datasets.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Overall the paper is written and presented properly.</p>

      <p>The methodology is well explained and understandable.</p>

      <p>The results are reproducible.</p>

      <p>The author has also performed the ablation study.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>There is a limited amount of novelty in the work as they have used the existing deep learning technique, i.e., variational graph Auto-encoder.</p>

      <p>Features visualization of the network is missing, which is essential for showing the learned distinguishable features of normal and patient.</p>

      <p>Why have authors chosen three graph convolutional layers for the encoder part? They need to justify with proper reasons.</p>

      <p>The amount of data over which GVAE has been trained very less. How authors overruled overfitting?</p>

      <p>The comparative results shown in Tables 1, 2 are very close. With less data it’s statistical relevance is questionable.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Based on the multi-view graph convolutional network, the authors attempted to extend the generalization ability of the newly proposed unified representation learning method into classifying both Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD). The accuracy of the proposed method was elevated when adding the representations of disentanglement and proportionality.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>the general prediction of neurodegenerative conditions is not a major concern in clinical considerations. Furthermore, Table 1 shows the classification accuracy of AD (ADNI and NACC) was much higher than that of PD (PPMI), which seemed contradictory to the original purpose of general prediction.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The authors stated that the prediction ability was complicated in respect to different tasks and heavily coupled with the algorithms. For example, the key representations of disentanglement and proportionality indeed enhanced accuracy and minimized the error (though its efficacy depends on the tasks); however, the corresponding neurophysiological evidence shall be stated.</p>

        <li>It would be better if the authors can show the dimension of variables (\sigma and \mu) to help my understanding.
2.To my understanding, the information extracted from multi-view connectome is just a feature map. Would it be possible to use this method to generate a refined connectome matrix which can be regarded as a weighted sum of multi-view connectomes.</li>
