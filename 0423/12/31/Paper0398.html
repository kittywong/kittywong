<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Andrei Svecic, Gilles Soulez, Frederic Monet, Raman Kashyap, Samuel Kadoury Abstract Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) revascularization is a common minimally invasive treatment for occlusions in peripheral arteries, but it’s success in long occlusions is limited by technical challenges associated with crossing occluded vessels and lumen re-entry. Revascularization needs to be guided closely using ionizing imaging such as fluoroscopy, while intravascular guidewires lack the capability of characterizing physiological conditions near occlusions, such as blood flow. We propose a multimodal sensing framework to infer both three-dimensional shape and vascular flow from an optical fiber device using random optical gratings enhanced with ultraviolet exposure, allowing a fully-distributed strain sensor. A two-branch spatio-temporal neural network is proposed to process a generated optical signal trajectory from scattered wavelength distributions. A shape network is first used in combination with the pre-procedural 3D angiography image to track the 3D shape related to backscattered wavelength shift, while a flow velocity network trained on 4D-MRI measurements allows to extract vascular flow. A final refinement is performed to adjust the 3D-2D projection onto C-arm images, allowing to correct for slight deviations of the sensed shape. Synthetic and porcine experiments were performed in a controlled environment setting, enabling to measure the accuracy of the 3D shape tracking and flow measurements, with errors of 2.4+/-0.9mm and flow differences below 2cm/s, demonstrating the ability to provide anatomical and physiological properties during vascular procedures.

These quantities are measured in a continuous fashion along the instrument, making use of noise-based Bragg gratings. The measured back-scattered wavelength data is fed to a data-driven method, together with a 3D segmentation of the target vasculature from a preoperative image. The neural network is able to reconstruct the shape of the instrument, given the raw data and the constraint of the segmented anatomy. This knowledge is in turn used to estimate the blood flow within the same data-driven approach. The results are finally refined based on intra-operative 2D angiographic images. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The proposed method addresses an important clinical need, i.e. measurement of blood flow for guiding percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. The approach allows to conduct this measurement continuously along the instrument, rather than point-based as when using fixed Bragg gratings at a few locations. The continuous distribution of the gratings allows to perform two tasks jointly, i.e. localization and physiological measurements, through a data-driven method. The validation is rigorous and makes the case for the clinical applicability of the method. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. It is not clear to me if these noise-based gratings can be reproducibly created, or if each instance of the catheter will require individual calibration and training of the network.

Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html Clarity: The text is well organized and clear. A lot of different things and topics are exposed through the paper, however which makes it difficult to read and understand the details. [19] is for example a prerequisite, and I am not convinced that the proposed transposition is as straightforward as the authors write. Method: This paper relies on a catheter equipped with 3 optical fibers with randomly placed Bragg gratings. It describes a method to both retrieve the catheter shape and surrounding flow measurements. The method is data-driven, vessel centerlines extracted from intra-operative X-ray imaging as projective shape constraints, and a segmented MRA volume both as 3D shape constraints (vessel centerlines), and for flow computation. 3 CNN are used: the first (ShapeNet) to recover the catheter shape, a second one (FlowNet) for the flow, which also takes the previous shape as input, and the shape is refined through RefineNet. The method is largely inspired by [19] (pose recovery from event cameras) and uses the same kind of notations. But many things are unclear: I understand that v_{i,h} is the position of the hth grating. But the notion of section N_H is unclear and so is the difference between P_l and v_{i,h}, with a very different notation for a 3D point. In [19], intensity images are only available for indices k, k+1, etc… C-arm images here play the role of intensity images. But then vessel centerlines are only available for indices i=0 and i=N and equation (2) is unclear: how p_{j,h} is determined for all j? I would assume the sum in equation (2) can only be computed with i=0 and i=N. On the contrary, I would understand why equation (3) would sum up over all i in [0,N], since you can ask for the shape to remain within the segmented MRA vessels at all intermediate time, but here it is only done for i=0 and i=N. Concerning this equation, I also ponder what the role of t’ might be. I understand in [19] it is used to correct for the motion of the character in the images, but its use is not so obvious in the paper. How is P_{f,l}^{3D} determined would also deserve some details (closest voxel in segmented MRA?). The \Psi function in FlowNet is undefined. The refinement network seems to use the same L_cor and L_temp as in ShapeNet, and its addition is thereafter unclear. How does the result of FlowNet influence the input of RefineNet? I cannot see any impact. Then why adjust a different shape from the one produced by ShapeNet? Could it be that RefineNet generates a shape that better reprojects onto the X-ray images? Then why not use this shape as input to FlowNet? How do the authors explain the difference between these two shapes? Furthermore, in the first lines of page 6, it is unclear whether vessel borders or centerlines are used as constraints. Setting 2D-3D shape correspondence purely on a shortest distance criterion has also been long known as suboptimal in 2D-3D vessel registration work and might result in outliers. Some details are provided for the various CNN used in the paper, but more details would be welcome, on the architecture as well as training (reference 3D shapes?). I assume that RefineNet uses the same network as ShapeNet? Data are acquired on 18 porcine models to train the CNNs, using 4D MRI as reference for blood flow measurements. Quantitative experiments are provided on phantom data, and also on 5 porcine models that compare the proposed approach with EM tracking and reconstruction with standard fibers. The proposed approach is shown to improve over both other methods, even though the accuracy still is around 2.5 mm in 3D. The shape information is demonstrated to improve blood flow measurements. A remaining question I have is about the capacity of the system to separate blood flow measurements from catheter motion when the interventionalist manipulates it. Or does this system requires that the catheter navigation is paused for the blood flow measurements to be accurate? Overall, I would suggest that the authors try to separate this work into two publications, or expand it into a journal paper. The MICCAI conference format appears too tight for the method to be exposed and assessed with confidence. This is the reason why I consider this paper as borderline. Typos: p. 5, two lines below equation 2: “the the inferred 3D point” please check for acronyms that need to be capitalized in the reference section (e.g. mri -&gt; MRI, Uv -&gt; UV, Cnn-&gt;CNN, etc…) Please state your overall opinion of the paper borderline accept (6) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? The reported work is impressive and the evaluation sufficient for a conference paper. However, I feel that this work would benefit from an expansion either in two separate publications or a long journal paper. As such the text is too concise and details are missing so that it is difficult to assess its validity. That is why I consider this paper borderline.

The paper is grounded the physical model of light scattering in optical fiber. The obtained signal is analyzed with neural networks. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. This paper describes a very complete set of experimentation with very encouraging results Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The main weakness is to convince that the available signal is sufficient to retrieve both the 3D shape and the flow. Some expertise in optical fiber and light back-scattering is required. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance Limited. This paper relies on a complex experimental setup Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html The work is interesting. You propose the analysis of the optical fiber signal with neural networks. It is very challenging to assess the pertinence oft this approach without a bit more knowledge of the physics of the set up. It is not intuitive that the information can be recovered. It is intuitive to understand that any curvature of the guidewire can be noticed. It is much less intuitive to understand how it is oriented in space. Please state your overall opinion of the paper out of scope (1) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? The paper content looks good and it reports a large set of valuable experimental work. However, I have a hard time to truly assess its content and I’m afraid that most of its content will be difficult for the average MICCAI readers. Indeed, I consider that this work can only be understood by a person familiar with optical fibers properties and the backscatter signal.

However, it should be emphasized the background and more details on sensor fabrication and optics processing can be found in the journal paper [11; Monet et al. 19], which also presents the hardware setup. We will emphasize this in sections 2.1 and 2.2. The focus of this paper is primarily on the neural networks, and believe it to be suitable for MICCAI. We feel this topic can be of great value to the MICCAI community, particularly for the CAI field, as it can be made aware of new fiber optical sensors which are developed for interventional usage, and how these can be integrated in an image-guided therapy workflow. A background on optics in not required to understand the proposed framework. If space is required to add details on the network methodology, details of the sensor fabrication will be removed from 2.1, as these are in [11; Monet et al. 19]. 2) Methods details: N_H is meant to indicate the number of gratings (fiber sections) along the optical fiber triplet. While the sensor gratings are continuous, this discretization is needed to evaluate the loss functions in a discrete manner. R2 also notes confusion in notation for the 3D points. The term P_l represents a 3D point from the reconstructed sensing data, while \textbf{P} represent a 3D point from the reference segmented MRA. The difference between v_I,h and P_l is that the first represent the projected 3D point onto the 2D images, while the second is the 3D coordinate taken from the reconstructed shape. We apologize for the confusion about the indices used in equations 2 and 3, we believe this was caused by a mistake in the notation [0,N], which may lead to believe only indices 0 and N are considered. In fact, we consider all frames between 0 and N, not just i=0 and i=N. Hence, we will change the formulation to [0,…,N] instead. The symbol /Psi represents the temporal convolutional network model used previously for motion-based analysis and predictions made from time-varying features. This will be clarified in the revised paper. t’ can be considered as a translation vector to align the 3D coordinates of the MRA with the sensing system. It allows to evaluate shapes in the same coordinate system. P_{f,l}^{3D} represents the 3D point coordinate of the 3D centerline from the MRA, corresponding to the frame f and gratting l. R2 is correct, RefineNet’s backbone is the same is ShapeNet. While similar to ShapeNet, RefineNet uses instead the losses L_stab and L_proj, which are different as they use different inputs, compared to L_cor and L_temp. Reviewer 2 is correct, we could have used the output of RefineNet as input to FlowNet. However based on experiments, it was shown that the adjustments brought by RefineNet did not bring any significant gain to the inferred flow values. We also observed the joint training between shape and flow networks was beneficial for convergence. Vessel borders are used as constraints for the refinement, not the centerline. While we agree with R2 that the shortest distance criterion has been long known as suboptimal for 2D-3D adjustments, the added stability term in the refinement network allows to maintain the overall 3D shape, thus avoid outliers which may generated only from 2D adjustments. The 3D shape reference in the MRA was not obtained using a neural network, but rather with a deformable surface mesh model described in [1; Badoual et al. 16]. The paper includes all parameter settings. We will clarify this in the manuscript. 3) System ability to separate blood flow measurements from catheter motion: Reviewer 2 is correct, navigation is paused when performing blood flow measurements. This allows to disentangle the wavelength shift features related to shape and flow measures. This will be clarified in the revised paper. back to top" />

Some details are provided for the various CNN used in the paper, but more details would be welcome, on the architecture as well as training (reference 3D shapes?). I assume that RefineNet uses the same network as ShapeNet? Data are acquired on 18 porcine models to train the CNNs, using 4D MRI as reference for blood flow measurements. Quantitative experiments are provided on phantom data, and also on 5 porcine models that compare the proposed approach with EM tracking and reconstruction with standard fibers. The proposed approach is shown to improve over both other methods, even though the accuracy still is around 2.5 mm in 3D. The shape information is demonstrated to improve blood flow measurements. A remaining question I have is about the capacity of the system to separate blood flow measurements from catheter motion when the interventionalist manipulates it. Or does this system requires that the catheter navigation is paused for the blood flow measurements to be accurate? Overall, I would suggest that the authors try to separate this work into two publications, or expand it into a journal paper.

However, it should be emphasized the background and more details on sensor fabrication and optics processing can be found in the journal paper [11; Monet et al. 19], which also presents the hardware setup. We will emphasize this in sections 2.1 and 2.2. The focus of this paper is primarily on the neural networks, and believe it to be suitable for MICCAI. We feel this topic can be of great value to the MICCAI community, particularly for the CAI field, as it can be made aware of new fiber optical sensors which are developed for interventional usage, and how these can be integrated in an image-guided therapy workflow. A background on optics in not required to understand the proposed framework. If space is required to add details on the network methodology, details of the sensor fabrication will be removed from 2.1, as these are in [11; Monet et al. 19]. 2) Methods details: N_H is meant to indicate the number of gratings (fiber sections) along the optical fiber triplet. While the sensor gratings are continuous, this discretization is needed to evaluate the loss functions in a discrete manner. R2 also notes confusion in notation for the 3D points. The term P_l represents a 3D point from the reconstructed sensing data, while \textbf{P} represent a 3D point from the reference segmented MRA. The difference between v_I,h and P_l is that the first represent the projected 3D point onto the 2D images, while the second is the 3D coordinate taken from the reconstructed shape. We apologize for the confusion about the indices used in equations 2 and 3, we believe this was caused by a mistake in the notation [0,N], which may lead to believe only indices 0 and N are considered. In fact, we consider all frames between 0 and N, not just i=0 and i=N. Hence, we will change the formulation to [0,…,N] instead. The symbol /Psi represents the temporal convolutional network model used previously for motion-based analysis and predictions made from time-varying features. This will be clarified in the revised paper. t’ can be considered as a translation vector to align the 3D coordinates of the MRA with the sensing system. It allows to evaluate shapes in the same coordinate system. P_{f,l}^{3D} represents the 3D point coordinate of the 3D centerline from the MRA, corresponding to the frame f and gratting l. R2 is correct, RefineNet’s backbone is the same is ShapeNet. While similar to ShapeNet, RefineNet uses instead the losses L_stab and L_proj, which are different as they use different inputs, compared to L_cor and L_temp. Reviewer 2 is correct, we could have used the output of RefineNet as input to FlowNet. However based on experiments, it was shown that the adjustments brought by RefineNet did not bring any significant gain to the inferred flow values. We also observed the joint training between shape and flow networks was beneficial for convergence. Vessel borders are used as constraints for the refinement, not the centerline. While we agree with R2 that the shortest distance criterion has been long known as suboptimal for 2D-3D adjustments, the added stability term in the refinement network allows to maintain the overall 3D shape, thus avoid outliers which may generated only from 2D adjustments. The 3D shape reference in the MRA was not obtained using a neural network, but rather with a deformable surface mesh model described in [1; Badoual et al. 16]. The paper includes all parameter settings. We will clarify this in the manuscript. 3) System ability to separate blood flow measurements from catheter motion: Reviewer 2 is correct, navigation is paused when performing blood flow measurements. This allows to disentangle the wavelength shift features related to shape and flow measures. This will be clarified in the revised paper. back to top" />

Revascularization needs to be guided closely using ionizing imaging such as fluoroscopy, while intravascular guidewires lack the capability of characterizing physiological conditions near occlusions, such as blood flow. We propose a multimodal sensing framework to infer both three-dimensional shape and vascular flow from an optical fiber device using random optical gratings enhanced with ultraviolet exposure, allowing a fully-distributed strain sensor. A two-branch spatio-temporal neural network is proposed to process a generated optical signal trajectory from scattered wavelength distributions. A shape network is first used in combination with the pre-procedural 3D angiography image to track the 3D shape related to backscattered wavelength shift, while a flow velocity network trained on 4D-MRI measurements allows to extract vascular flow. A final refinement is performed to adjust the 3D-2D projection onto C-arm images, allowing to correct for slight deviations of the sensed shape. Synthetic and porcine experiments were performed in a controlled environment setting, enabling to measure the accuracy of the 3D shape tracking and flow measurements, with errors of 2.4+/-0.9mm and flow differences below 2cm/s, demonstrating the ability to provide anatomical and physiological properties during vascular procedures.

These quantities are measured in a continuous fashion along the instrument, making use of noise-based Bragg gratings. The measured back-scattered wavelength data is fed to a data-driven method, together with a 3D segmentation of the target vasculature from a preoperative image. The neural network is able to reconstruct the shape of the instrument, given the raw data and the constraint of the segmented anatomy. This knowledge is in turn used to estimate the blood flow within the same data-driven approach. The results are finally refined based on intra-operative 2D angiographic images. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The proposed method addresses an important clinical need, i.e. measurement of blood flow for guiding percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. The approach allows to conduct this measurement continuously along the instrument, rather than point-based as when using fixed Bragg gratings at a few locations. The continuous distribution of the gratings allows to perform two tasks jointly, i.e. localization and physiological measurements, through a data-driven method. The validation is rigorous and makes the case for the clinical applicability of the method. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. It is not clear to me if these noise-based gratings can be reproducibly created, or if each instance of the catheter will require individual calibration and training of the network. This may limit the applicability of the technique, or make it very expensive. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Excellent Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper.

Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The hardware part cannot be reproduced easily. Details are insufficient in the paper to confidently reproduce the algorithm section.

Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html Clarity: The text is well organized and clear. A lot of different things and topics are exposed through the paper, however which makes it difficult to read and understand the details. [19] is for example a prerequisite, and I am not convinced that the proposed transposition is as straightforward as the authors write. Method: This paper relies on a catheter equipped with 3 optical fibers with randomly placed Bragg gratings. It describes a method to both retrieve the catheter shape and surrounding flow measurements. The method is data-driven, vessel centerlines extracted from intra-operative X-ray imaging as projective shape constraints, and a segmented MRA volume both as 3D shape constraints (vessel centerlines), and for flow computation. 3 CNN are used: the first (ShapeNet) to recover the catheter shape, a second one (FlowNet) for the flow, which also takes the previous shape as input, and the shape is refined through RefineNet. The method is largely inspired by [19] (pose recovery from event cameras) and uses the same kind of notations. But many things are unclear: I understand that v_{i,h} is the position of the hth grating. But the notion of section N_H is unclear and so is the difference between P_l and v_{i,h}, with a very different notation for a 3D point. In [19], intensity images are only available for indices k, k+1, etc… C-arm images here play the role of intensity images. But then vessel centerlines are only available for indices i=0 and i=N and equation (2) is unclear: how p_{j,h} is determined for all j? I would assume the sum in equation (2) can only be computed with i=0 and i=N. On the contrary, I would understand why equation (3) would sum up over all i in [0,N], since you can ask for the shape to remain within the segmented MRA vessels at all intermediate time, but here it is only done for i=0 and i=N. Concerning this equation, I also ponder what the role of t’ might be. I understand in [19] it is used to correct for the motion of the character in the images, but its use is not so obvious in the paper. How is P_{f,l}^{3D} determined would also deserve some details (closest voxel in segmented MRA?). The \\Psi function in FlowNet is undefined. The refinement network seems to use the same L_cor and L_temp as in ShapeNet, and its addition is thereafter unclear. How does the result of FlowNet influence the input of RefineNet? I cannot see any impact. Then why adjust a different shape from the one produced by ShapeNet? Could it be that RefineNet generates a shape that better reprojects onto the X-ray images? Then why not use this shape as input to FlowNet? How do the authors explain the difference between these two shapes? Furthermore, in the first lines of page 6, it is unclear whether vessel borders or centerlines are used as constraints. Setting 2D-3D shape correspondence purely on a shortest distance criterion has also been long known as suboptimal in 2D-3D vessel registration work and might result in outliers. Some details are provided for the various CNN used in the paper, but more details would be welcome, on the architecture as well as training (reference 3D shapes?).

We feel this topic can be of great value to the MICCAI community, particularly for the CAI field, as it can be made aware of new fiber optical sensors which are developed for interventional usage, and how these can be integrated in an image-guided therapy workflow. A background on optics in not required to understand the proposed framework. If space is required to add details on the network methodology, details of the sensor fabrication will be removed from 2.1, as these are in [11; Monet et al. 19]. 2) Methods details: N_H is meant to indicate the number of gratings (fiber sections) along the optical fiber triplet. While the sensor gratings are continuous, this discretization is needed to evaluate the loss functions in a discrete manner. R2 also notes confusion in notation for the 3D points. The term P_l represents a 3D point from the reconstructed sensing data, while \\textbf{P} represent a 3D point from the reference segmented MRA. The difference between v_I,h and P_l is that the first represent the projected 3D point onto the 2D images, while the second is the 3D coordinate taken from the reconstructed shape. We apologize for the confusion about the indices used in equations 2 and 3, we believe this was caused by a mistake in the notation [0,N], which may lead to believe only indices 0 and N are considered. In fact, we consider all frames between 0 and N, not just i=0 and i=N. Hence, we will change the formulation to [0,…,N] instead. The symbol /Psi represents the temporal convolutional network model used previously for motion-based analysis and predictions made from time-varying features. This will be clarified in the revised paper. t’ can be considered as a translation vector to align the 3D coordinates of the MRA with the sensing system. It allows to evaluate shapes in the same coordinate system. P_{f,l}^{3D} represents the 3D point coordinate of the 3D centerline from the MRA, corresponding to the frame f and gratting l. R2 is correct, RefineNet’s backbone is the same is ShapeNet. While similar to ShapeNet, RefineNet uses instead the losses L_stab and L_proj, which are different as they use different inputs, compared to L_cor and L_temp. Reviewer 2 is correct, we could have used the output of RefineNet as input to FlowNet. However based on experiments, it was shown that the adjustments brought by RefineNet did not bring any significant gain to the inferred flow values. We also observed the joint training between shape and flow networks was beneficial for convergence. Vessel borders are used as constraints for the refinement, not the centerline. While we agree with R2 that the shortest distance criterion has been long known as suboptimal for 2D-3D adjustments, the added stability term in the refinement network allows to maintain the overall 3D shape, thus avoid outliers which may generated only from 2D adjustments. The 3D shape reference in the MRA was not obtained using a neural network, but rather with a deformable surface mesh model described in [1; Badoual et al. 16]. The paper includes all parameter settings. We will clarify this in the manuscript. 3) System ability to separate blood flow measurements from catheter motion: Reviewer 2 is correct, navigation is paused when performing blood flow measurements. This allows to disentangle the wavelength shift features related to shape and flow measures. This will be clarified in the revised paper. back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) revascularization is a common minimally invasive treatment for occlusions in peripheral arteries, but it’s success in long occlusions is limited by technical challenges associated with crossing occluded vessels and lumen re-entry. Revascularization needs to be guided closely using ionizing imaging such as fluoroscopy, while intravascular guidewires lack the capability of characterizing physiological conditions near occlusions, such as blood flow. We propose a multimodal sensing framework to infer both three-dimensional shape and vascular flow from an optical fiber device using random optical gratings enhanced with ultraviolet exposure, allowing a fully-distributed strain sensor. A two-branch spatio-temporal neural network is proposed to process a generated optical signal trajectory from scattered wavelength distributions. A shape network is first used in combination with the pre-procedural 3D angiography image to track the 3D shape related to backscattered wavelength shift, while a flow velocity network trained on 4D-MRI measurements allows to extract vascular flow. A final refinement is performed to adjust the 3D-2D projection onto C-arm images, allowing to correct for slight deviations of the sensed shape. Synthetic and porcine experiments were performed in a controlled environment setting, enabling to measure the accuracy of the 3D shape tracking and flow measurements, with errors of 2.4+/-0.9mm and flow differences below 2cm/s, demonstrating the ability to provide anatomical and physiological properties during vascular procedures.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The authors propose a technique for joint measurement of the 3D pose of a catheter within a vasculature, and of the blood flow within said vasculature. These quantities are measured in a continuous fashion along the instrument, making use of noise-based Bragg gratings. The measured back-scattered wavelength data is fed to a data-driven method, together with a 3D segmentation of the target vasculature from a preoperative image. The neural network is able to reconstruct the shape of the instrument, given the raw data and the constraint of the segmented anatomy. This knowledge is in turn used to estimate the blood flow within the same data-driven approach. The results are finally refined based on intra-operative 2D angiographic images.</p>

      <p>The proposed method addresses an important clinical need, i.e. measurement of blood flow for guiding percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.</p>

      <p>The approach allows to conduct this measurement continuously along the instrument, rather than point-based as when using fixed Bragg gratings at a few locations. The continuous distribution of the gratings allows to perform two tasks jointly, i.e. localization and physiological measurements, through a data-driven method.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Clarity: The text is well organized and clear. A lot of different things and topics are exposed through the paper, however which makes it difficult to read and understand the details. [19] is for example a prerequisite, and I am not convinced that the proposed transposition is as straightforward as the authors write.</p>

      <p>Method: This paper relies on a catheter equipped with 3 optical fibers with randomly placed Bragg gratings. It describes a method to both retrieve the catheter shape and surrounding flow measurements. The method is data-driven, vessel centerlines extracted from intra-operative X-ray imaging as projective shape constraints, and a segmented MRA volume both as 3D shape constraints (vessel centerlines), and for flow computation.  3 CNN are used: the first (ShapeNet) to recover the catheter shape, a second one (FlowNet) for the flow, which also takes the previous shape as input, and the shape is refined through RefineNet. The method is largely inspired by [19] (pose recovery from event cameras) and uses the same kind of notations.</p>

      <p>But many things are unclear: I understand that v_{i,h} is the position of the hth grating. But the notion of section N_H is unclear and so is the difference between P_l and v_{i,h}, with a very different notation for a 3D point. In [19], intensity images are only available for indices k, k+1, etc… C-arm images here play the role of intensity images. But then vessel centerlines are only available for indices i=0 and i=N and equation (2) is unclear: how p_{j,h} is determined for all j? I would assume the sum in equation (2) can only be computed with i=0 and i=N. On the contrary, I would understand why equation (3) would sum up over all i in [0,N], since you can ask for the shape to remain within the segmented MRA vessels at all intermediate time, but here it is only done for i=0 and i=N. Concerning this equation, I also ponder what the role of t’ might be. I understand in [19] it is used to correct for the motion of the character in the images, but its use is not so obvious in the paper. How is P_{f,l}^{3D} determined would also deserve some details (closest voxel in segmented MRA?). The \Psi function in FlowNet is undefined.</p>

      <p>The refinement network seems to use the same L_cor and L_temp as in ShapeNet, and its addition is thereafter unclear. How does the result of FlowNet influence the input of RefineNet? I cannot see any impact. Then why adjust a different shape from the one produced by ShapeNet? Could it be that RefineNet generates a shape that better reprojects onto the X-ray images? Then why not use this shape as input to FlowNet? How do the authors explain the difference between these two shapes? Furthermore, in the first lines of page 6, it is unclear whether vessel borders or centerlines are used as constraints. Setting 2D-3D shape correspondence purely on a shortest distance criterion has also been long known as suboptimal in 2D-3D vessel registration work and might result in outliers.</p>

      <p>Some details are provided for the various CNN used in the paper, but more details would be welcome, on the architecture as well as training (reference 3D shapes?). I assume that RefineNet uses the same network as ShapeNet?</p>

      <p>Data are acquired on 18 porcine models to train the CNNs, using 4D MRI as reference for blood flow measurements. Quantitative experiments are provided on phantom data, and also on 5 porcine models that compare the proposed approach with EM tracking and reconstruction with standard fibers. The proposed approach is shown to improve over both other methods, even though the accuracy still is around 2.5 mm in 3D. The shape information is demonstrated to improve blood flow measurements.</p>

      <p>A remaining question I have is about the capacity of the system to separate blood flow measurements from catheter motion when the interventionalist manipulates it. Or does this system requires that the catheter navigation is paused for the blood flow measurements to be accurate?</p>

      <p>Overall, I would suggest that the authors try to separate this work into two publications, or expand it into a journal paper. The MICCAI conference format appears too tight for the method to be exposed and assessed with confidence. This is the reason why I consider this paper as borderline.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The work is interesting. You propose the analysis of the optical fiber signal with neural networks. It is very challenging to assess the pertinence oft this approach without a bit more knowledge of the physics of the set up. It is not intuitive that the information can be recovered. It is intuitive to understand that any curvature of the guidewire can be noticed. It is much less intuitive to understand how it is oriented in space.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The paper content looks good and it reports a large set of valuable experimental work. However, I have a hard time to truly assess its content and I’m afraid that most of its content will be difficult for the average MICCAI readers. Indeed, I consider that this work can only be understood by a person familiar with optical fibers properties and the backscatter signal.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The paper proposes the first use of a multimodal optical sensing device integrated with a catheter for arterial intervention, enabling inference of both 3D shape and vascular flow simultaneously in real-time using random optical gratings enhanced with ultraviolet exposure. The framework is validated in both phantom and in-vivo porcine experiments, achieving promising accuracies in 3D shape tracking and blood flow measurements. The topic is of clinical interest; the paper is well written and presents substantial contribution, both in terms of hardware and algorithms.</p>

      <p>The main concern regarding the work is regarding the large scope of the paper, covering different topics and components, and as a result missing some necessary details in the methodology.
The following points should be addressed in the rebuttal:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clarifications regarding the scope of the paper, and what modifications are reasonable within the scope of the rebuttal to improve on scope concerns highlighted by reviewer 2.</li>
        <li>Clarifications regarding missing details in methodology, including details of the shape and flow networks and refinement network</li>
        <li>Better Justification for choice of methodology, and its sufficiency for retrieving both catheter shape and surrounding flow, and associated limitations (e.g. capacity to separate blood flow from other catheter motion)</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>We thank the reviewers and AC for their valuable comments. 
1) Scope of paper by R2 and R3:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We agree that the combination of optics and imaging aspects may seem as too much for a MICCAI paper. However, it should be emphasized the background and more details on sensor fabrication and optics processing can be found in the journal paper [11; Monet et al. 19], which also presents the hardware setup. We will emphasize this in sections 2.1 and 2.2. The focus of this paper is primarily on the neural networks, and believe it to be suitable for MICCAI. We feel this topic can be of great value to the MICCAI community, particularly for the CAI field, as it can be made aware of new fiber optical sensors which are developed for interventional usage, and how these can be integrated in an image-guided therapy workflow. A background on optics in not required to understand the proposed framework. If space is required to add details on the network methodology, details of the sensor fabrication will be removed from 2.1, as these are in [11; Monet et al. 19].</li>
  </ul>

  <p>2) Methods details:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>N_H is meant to indicate the number of gratings (fiber sections) along the optical fiber triplet. While the sensor gratings are continuous, this discretization is needed to evaluate the loss functions in a discrete manner.</li>
    <li>R2 also notes confusion in notation for the 3D points. The term P_l represents a 3D point from the reconstructed sensing data, while \textbf{P} represent a 3D point from the reference segmented MRA.</li>
    <li>The difference between v_I,h and P_l is that the first represent the projected 3D point onto the 2D images, while the second is the 3D coordinate taken from the reconstructed shape.</li>
    <li>We apologize for the confusion about the indices used in equations 2 and 3, we believe this was caused by a mistake in the notation [0,N], which may lead to believe only indices 0 and N are considered. In fact, we consider all frames between 0 and N, not just i=0 and i=N. Hence, we will change the formulation to [0,…,N] instead.</li>
    <li>The symbol /Psi represents the temporal convolutional network model used previously for motion-based analysis and predictions made from time-varying features. This will be clarified in the revised paper.</li>
    <li>t’ can be considered as a translation vector to align the 3D coordinates of the MRA with the sensing system. It allows to evaluate shapes in the same coordinate system.</li>
    <li>P_{f,l}^{3D} represents the 3D point coordinate of the 3D centerline from the MRA, corresponding to the frame f and gratting l.</li>
    <li>R2 is correct, RefineNet’s backbone is the same is ShapeNet.</li>
    <li>While similar to ShapeNet, RefineNet uses instead the losses L_stab and L_proj, which are different as they use different inputs, compared to L_cor and L_temp.</li>
    <li>Reviewer 2 is correct, we could have used the output of RefineNet as input to FlowNet. However based on experiments, it was shown that the adjustments brought by RefineNet did not bring any significant gain to the inferred flow values. We also observed the joint training between shape and flow networks was beneficial for convergence.</li>
    <li>Vessel borders are used as constraints for the refinement, not the centerline. While we agree with R2 that the shortest distance criterion has been long known as suboptimal for 2D-3D adjustments, the added stability term in the refinement network allows to maintain the overall 3D shape, thus avoid outliers which may generated only from 2D adjustments.</li>
    <li>The 3D shape reference in the MRA was not obtained using a neural network, but rather with a deformable surface mesh model described in [1; Badoual et al. 16]. The paper includes all parameter settings. We will clarify this in the manuscript.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>3) System ability to separate blood flow measurements from catheter motion:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reviewer 2 is correct, navigation is paused when performing blood flow measurements. This allows to disentangle the wavelength shift features related to shape and flow measures. This will be clarified in the revised paper.</li>
  </ul>
