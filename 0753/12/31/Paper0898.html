<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Mianxin Liu, Han Zhang, Feng Shi, Dinggang Shen Abstract Latest diagnostic studies at the preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease focus on dynamic functional connectivity network (dFCN) from resting-state fMRI. However, the existing methods fall short in at least two aspects: 1) Single-scale atlas is generally used for building the dFCN, while functional interactions at and cross multiple spatial scales are largely neglected; 2) Features extracted from dFCN at each time segment are often simply pooled together, whereas the disease related meta-states, i.e., dFCN configurations, appear transiently and may not be sensitively captured. In the presented study, we designed multiscale atlas-based graph convolutional network, and utilized a multiple-instance-learning pooling to tackle these issues. First, we leveraged those previously established multiscale atlases to build hierarchical brain networks, represented by multiscale graphs, which were also applied to different time segments to form dFCNs. At each time segment, we processed these multiscale graphs by our specially designed multiscale graph convolutional networks that were connected based on the inter-scale hierarchy. A long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture was then implemented to pro-cess temporal information of the dFCN. The output from the LSTM was pooled with attention-based multiple instance learning to dynamically assign larger weights to disease related (more diagnostic) transient states. Experiments on 481 subjects show that our method achieved 77.78% accuracy (with 75.00% sensitivity and 78.57% specificity) in healthy control vs. early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) classification, which outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. Our study not only fits the practical needs of eMCI diagnosis with resting-state fMRI but also highlights that the pathological of eMCI could manifest as abnormal transient meta-states of multiscale functional interactions.

Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 1 Author Feedback Answer to common questions (R1’s Q1, R2’s Q1 and R3’s Q1 and Q2): Below we clarify common concerns on reproducibility. Implementation details The proposed model was implemented using Pytorch and trained with epoch=100, learning rate=0.001 and batch size=30. Adam was used as optimizer with weight decay=0.01 to avoid overfitting. The training of the network was accelerated by one Nvidia GTX 3080 GPU, and the time cost was around 30 minutes in the current dataset. To address the sample imbalance, we applied a weighted cross-entropy as the loss function. The weights were the inverse of the sample ratio in the training set (ranging from 1/3 to 1/4). MAGCN model architecture We used the spectral graph convolution (Kipf and Welling 2017) to build GCN. The GCN is with ReLU activation function and dropout (rate=0.3). We then built the MAGCN with stacks of GCNs and atlas mappings in a hierarchical manner (Fig 3). The output from MAGCN was inputted to a classical LSTM (with all-zero matrix as initial hidden state), followed by the MIL-pooling and one fully-connected layer with Softmax to generate diagnosis. Answer to R1: Q2: There need more experiments especially comparison with other methods. A2: First, please note that, although there are existing “multiscale” analyses working on single atlas based dFCN, few method used multiple dFCNs constructed using multiscale atlases on fMRI signal exists. Therefore, we compared our methods with voting and concatenation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our multiscale fusion scheme. In addition, we used a modified “Graph-U-Net” to replace our MAGCN (Gao and Ji, 2019), which extracts the hierarchical presentation of given single-scale graph in data-driven manner. With comparable architecture, on dFCN with 300 ROIs, it obtained 75.55% ACC, 60.00% SEN and 80.00% SPE at best, which did not outperform MAGCN. Q3: What is the influence of different atlas? A3: In the presented study, we aimed to utilize the spatial overlapping relationship in the multiscale atlases as a proxy of the true biological hierarchy. In principle, a more precise description of the biological hierarchy from the atlas should offer better diagnosis accuracy and vise versa. The Schafer’s atlas provides a set of brain functional parcellations at multiple scales, all of which preserve spatial structures of brain functional networks. Such an atlas is currently the most advanced and biologically-meaningful functional hierarchical parcellation, thus the best choice for our study. Answer to R2: Q2: The process, atlas mapping in MAGCN, just uses the mean value of several small ROIs from the same coarse parcellation, is it means that the smaller ROI from the same coarse parcellation has a great effect in MAGCN than the bigger one? A2: If we understand correctly, the question is whether, in outputs of MAGCN, the node features for finer-scale FCN are more predictive for diagnosis. Please note that atlas mapping performs a summing on the node features at fine scale, as the mapping matrix is filled with 1s. Thus, it respects differences in ROI size and brain hierarchy information from the atlases during the node aggregation, which could reserve more information than simple averaging. In addition, in Table 1, performances of single-atlas-based methods did not monotonically increase along with scale changes, probably due to different associations from FCNs at scales to disease. So the features from fine scale may not necessarily have a greater effect in MAGCN. Q3: The conclusion about meta-state just comes from one eMCI subject. Is it stable in all of the subjects? A3: We extracted the normal and eMCI meta-states from all subjects and averaged them, respectively. The averaged eMCI meta-states show more broken module structures than the averaged normal meta-states, and thus the conclusion is stable. This description will be added to our final manuscript.

However, the existing methods fall short in at least two aspects: 1) Single-scale atlas is generally used for building the dFCN, while functional interactions at and cross multiple spatial scales are largely neglected; 2) Features extracted from dFCN at each time segment are often simply pooled together, whereas the disease related meta-states, i.e., dFCN configurations, appear transiently and may not be sensitively captured. In the presented study, we designed multiscale atlas-based graph convolutional network, and utilized a multiple-instance-learning pooling to tackle these issues. First, we leveraged those previously established multiscale atlases to build hierarchical brain networks, represented by multiscale graphs, which were also applied to different time segments to form dFCNs. At each time segment, we processed these multiscale graphs by our specially designed multiscale graph convolutional networks that were connected based on the inter-scale hierarchy. A long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture was then implemented to pro-cess temporal information of the dFCN. The output from the LSTM was pooled with attention-based multiple instance learning to dynamically assign larger weights to disease related (more diagnostic) transient states. Experiments on 481 subjects show that our method achieved 77.78% accuracy (with 75.00% sensitivity and 78.57% specificity) in healthy control vs. early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) classification, which outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. Our study not only fits the practical needs of eMCI diagnosis with resting-state fMRI but also highlights that the pathological of eMCI could manifest as abnormal transient meta-states of multiscale functional interactions.

Implementation details The proposed model was implemented using Pytorch and trained with epoch=100, learning rate=0.001 and batch size=30. Adam was used as optimizer with weight decay=0.01 to avoid overfitting. The training of the network was accelerated by one Nvidia GTX 3080 GPU, and the time cost was around 30 minutes in the current dataset. To address the sample imbalance, we applied a weighted cross-entropy as the loss function. The weights were the inverse of the sample ratio in the training set (ranging from 1/3 to 1/4). MAGCN model architecture We used the spectral graph convolution (Kipf and Welling 2017) to build GCN. The GCN is with ReLU activation function and dropout (rate=0.3). We then built the MAGCN with stacks of GCNs and atlas mappings in a hierarchical manner (Fig 3). The output from MAGCN was inputted to a classical LSTM (with all-zero matrix as initial hidden state), followed by the MIL-pooling and one fully-connected layer with Softmax to generate diagnosis. Answer to R1: Q2: There need more experiments especially comparison with other methods. A2: First, please note that, although there are existing “multiscale” analyses working on single atlas based dFCN, few method used multiple dFCNs constructed using multiscale atlases on fMRI signal exists. Therefore, we compared our methods with voting and concatenation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our multiscale fusion scheme. In addition, we used a modified “Graph-U-Net” to replace our MAGCN (Gao and Ji, 2019), which extracts the hierarchical presentation of given single-scale graph in data-driven manner. With comparable architecture, on dFCN with 300 ROIs, it obtained 75.55% ACC, 60.00% SEN and 80.00% SPE at best, which did not outperform MAGCN. Q3: What is the influence of different atlas? A3: In the presented study, we aimed to utilize the spatial overlapping relationship in the multiscale atlases as a proxy of the true biological hierarchy. In principle, a more precise description of the biological hierarchy from the atlas should offer better diagnosis accuracy and vise versa. The Schafer’s atlas provides a set of brain functional parcellations at multiple scales, all of which preserve spatial structures of brain functional networks. Such an atlas is currently the most advanced and biologically-meaningful functional hierarchical parcellation, thus the best choice for our study. Answer to R2: Q2: The process, atlas mapping in MAGCN, just uses the mean value of several small ROIs from the same coarse parcellation, is it means that the smaller ROI from the same coarse parcellation has a great effect in MAGCN than the bigger one? A2: If we understand correctly, the question is whether, in outputs of MAGCN, the node features for finer-scale FCN are more predictive for diagnosis. Please note that atlas mapping performs a summing on the node features at fine scale, as the mapping matrix is filled with 1s. Thus, it respects differences in ROI size and brain hierarchy information from the atlases during the node aggregation, which could reserve more information than simple averaging. In addition, in Table 1, performances of single-atlas-based methods did not monotonically increase along with scale changes, probably due to different associations from FCNs at scales to disease. So the features from fine scale may not necessarily have a greater effect in MAGCN. Q3: The conclusion about meta-state just comes from one eMCI subject. Is it stable in all of the subjects? A3: We extracted the normal and eMCI meta-states from all subjects and averaged them, respectively. The averaged eMCI meta-states show more broken module structures than the averaged normal meta-states, and thus the conclusion is stable. This description will be added to our final manuscript. Answer to R3: Please refer to “Answer to common questions”. back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Latest diagnostic studies at the preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease focus on dynamic functional connectivity network (dFCN) from resting-state fMRI. However, the existing methods fall short in at least two aspects: 1) Single-scale atlas is generally used for building the dFCN, while functional interactions at and cross multiple spatial scales are largely neglected; 2) Features extracted from dFCN at each time segment are often simply pooled together, whereas the disease related meta-states, i.e., dFCN configurations, appear transiently and may not be sensitively captured. In the presented study, we designed multiscale atlas-based graph convolutional network, and utilized a multiple-instance-learning pooling to tackle these issues. First, we leveraged those previously established multiscale atlases to build hierarchical brain networks, represented by multiscale graphs, which were also applied to different time segments to form dFCNs. At each time segment, we processed these multiscale graphs by our specially designed multiscale graph convolutional networks that were connected based on the inter-scale hierarchy. A long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture was then implemented to pro-cess temporal information of the dFCN. The output from the LSTM was pooled with attention-based multiple instance learning to dynamically assign larger weights to disease related (more diagnostic) transient states. Experiments on 481 subjects show that our method achieved 77.78% accuracy (with 75.00% sensitivity and 78.57% specificity) in healthy control vs. early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) classification, which outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. Our study not only fits the practical needs of eMCI diagnosis with resting-state fMRI but also highlights that the pathological of eMCI could manifest as abnormal transient meta-states of multiscale functional interactions.

  <p>Answer to common questions (R1’s Q1, R2’s Q1 and R3’s Q1 and Q2):
Below we clarify common concerns on reproducibility.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Implementation details
The proposed model was implemented using Pytorch and trained with epoch=100, learning rate=0.001 and batch size=30. Adam was used as optimizer with weight decay=0.01 to avoid overfitting. The training of the network was accelerated by one Nvidia GTX 3080 GPU, and the time cost was around 30 minutes in the current dataset. To address the sample imbalance, we applied a weighted cross-entropy as the loss function. The weights were the inverse of the sample ratio in the training set (ranging from 1/3 to 1/4).</li>
    <li>MAGCN model architecture
We used the spectral graph convolution (Kipf and Welling 2017) to build GCN. The GCN is with ReLU activation function and dropout (rate=0.3). We then built the MAGCN with stacks of GCNs and atlas mappings in a hierarchical manner (Fig 3). The output from MAGCN was inputted to a classical LSTM (with all-zero matrix as initial hidden state), followed by the MIL-pooling and one fully-connected layer with Softmax to generate diagnosis.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Answer to R1:
Q2: There need more experiments especially comparison with other methods.
A2: First, please note that, although there are existing “multiscale” analyses working on single atlas based dFCN, few method used multiple dFCNs constructed using multiscale atlases on fMRI signal exists. Therefore, we compared our methods with voting and concatenation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our multiscale fusion scheme.
In addition, we used a modified “Graph-U-Net” to replace our MAGCN (Gao and Ji, 2019), which extracts the hierarchical presentation of given single-scale graph in data-driven manner. With comparable architecture, on dFCN with 300 ROIs, it obtained 75.55% ACC, 60.00% SEN and 80.00% SPE at best, which did not outperform MAGCN.
Q3: What is the influence of different atlas?
A3: In the presented study, we aimed to utilize the spatial overlapping relationship in the multiscale atlases as a proxy of the true biological hierarchy. In principle, a more precise description of the biological hierarchy from the atlas should offer better diagnosis accuracy and vise versa.
The Schafer’s atlas provides a set of brain functional parcellations at multiple scales, all of  which preserve spatial structures of brain functional networks. Such an atlas is currently the most advanced and biologically-meaningful functional hierarchical parcellation, thus the best choice for our study.</p>

  <p>Answer to R2:
Q2: The process, atlas mapping in MAGCN, just uses the mean value of several small ROIs from the same coarse parcellation, is it means that the smaller ROI from the same coarse parcellation has a great effect in MAGCN than the bigger one?
A2: If we understand correctly, the question is whether, in outputs of MAGCN, the node features for finer-scale FCN are more predictive for diagnosis.
Please note that atlas mapping performs a summing on the node features at fine scale, as the mapping matrix is filled with 1s. Thus, it respects differences in ROI size and brain hierarchy information from the atlases during the node aggregation, which could reserve more information than simple averaging.
In addition, in Table 1, performances of single-atlas-based methods did not monotonically increase along with scale changes, probably due to different associations from FCNs at scales to disease. So the features from fine scale may not necessarily have a greater effect in MAGCN.
Q3: The conclusion about meta-state just comes from one eMCI subject. Is it stable in all of the subjects?
A3: We extracted the normal and eMCI meta-states from all subjects and averaged them, respectively. The averaged eMCI meta-states show more broken module structures than the averaged normal meta-states, and thus the conclusion is stable. This description will be added to our final manuscript.</p>

  <p>Answer to R3:
Please refer to “Answer to common questions”.</p>
