<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Christian Schiffer, Katrin Amunts, Stefan Harmeling, Timo Dickscheid Abstract Cytoarchitecture describes the spatial organization of neuronal cells in the brain, including their arrangement into layers and columns with respect to cell density, orientation, or presence of certain cell types. It allows to segregate the brain into cortical areas and subcortical nuclei, links structure with connectivity and function, and provides a microstructural reference for human brain atlases. Mapping boundaries between areas requires to scan histological sections at microscopic resolution. While recent high-throughput scanners allow to scan a complete human brain in the order of a year, it is practically impossible to delineate regions at the same pace using the established gold standard method. Researchers have recently addressed cytoarchitectonic mapping of cortical regions with deep neural networks, relying on image patches from individual 2D sections for classification. However, the 3D context, which is needed to disambiguate complex or obliquely cut brain regions, is not taken into account. In this work, we combine 2D histology with 3D topology by reformulating the mapping task as a node classification problem on an approximate 3D midsurface mesh through the isocortex. We extract deep features from cortical patches in 2D histological sections which are descriptive of cytoarchitecture, and assign them to the corresponding nodes on the 3D mesh to construct a large attributed graph. By solving the brain mapping problem on this graph using graph neural networks, we obtain significantly improved classification results. The proposed framework lends itself nicely to integration of additional neuroanatomical priors for mapping.

Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html It is not entirely clear if the feature encoders are the 2D approaches used prior to the proposed GNN architecture. A clearer description of this section would be beneficial. The GNN architectures all have 3 layers suggesting that the sub-graphs used have 3-hop nodes and when 5-layer is tested, 5-hop information. Comparing SAGE[5] and 7-layer network and potentially deeper networks to find the effect of depth. With both SAGE and GAT, generalizability to unseen brain, though marginal, appears to be with the shallower network while deeper is better for known images. Would this be attributed to the neighborhood? A deeper search on the neighborhood vs depth relationship would be interesting. Prior knowledge is provided to which architecture from Table 2?

Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html Though the method’s performance on unseen brain is low, I think it is still useful to fill the annotation for a sparsely annotated brain. For this goal, it is desired to show result with different level of annotation sparsity. Current experiment setup did not consider this. Annotation is not sparse and the ratio between annotated and not annotated slice is fixed by 8:2. Contrastive loss is usually used for self-supervised training when sample label is not available. In proposed method, the label of sample is available. In this case, it is more straight forward to use cross entropy loss. what is the advantage and motivation of using contrastive loss here?

The paper proposes a graph-based learning approach to parcellate the brain surface from very high resolution histology. The used methodology extracts a mid-surface cortical mesh, learns cortical features to define surface nodal data, and learns the cytoarchitecture labeling using a graph network to exploit the geometry of the brain surface. Evaluation is on 7 brains. One reviewer appreciates exploiting 2D histology in a 3D topology approach. A second reviewer appreciates the application but questions novelty in terms of GNN. A third reviewer also highlights the new application and has minor technical questions, but blocks at a missing comparison. A fourth reviewer appreciates the application but questions low results on an unseen brain. The general consensus is on a potentially impactful application. The developed tools are mostly existing and combines them in order to leverage 2D histology in a 3D setting. The contribution is on the high resolution parcellation rather than methodological. The submission, however, emphasizes on the methodological novelty, which is less relevant in my opinion since, as pointed out by the reviewers, all components already mostly exist. Data is very small in number of subjects, however this is unreasonable to think they can acquire and label hundreds of such data. This is all well defended by the authors in their rebuttal. In my opinion, the paper should better focus on the provided data since it is really contributing towards a clinical contribution rather than an algorithmic contribution. In its current form, the paper proposes a pipeline, less interesting from a methodological aspect as noted by the reviewer, but which could lead to better brain maps. It constitutes an advancement from 2D methods in histology. For these reasons, Recommendation is toward Acceptance.

One point of criticism to which we would like to respond, was that a comparison with other state of the art methods would be missing. The state of the art is already represented in our experiments by the “base” model. It implements the method proposed in [21] (please see manuscript for references), and to the best of our knowledge is the currently best performing approach for automated cytoarchitecture classification. The only difference between our implementation (base) and [21] is the final classifier: We use an MLP in place of the linear classifier to better compare the architectures to the GNN approach. We will add a reference to [21] in the respective row of Table 2 to make this clearer. Our decision to use supervised contrastive learning (defining sample similarity based on labels) is also based on the result from [21] that contrastive learning outperforms cross-entropy training for the given task. It was furthermore noted that the GNN architectures in the proposed approach are not novel. This is correct. Our main contribution is to apply the established GNN architectures GraphSAGE and GAT to the challenging problem of cytoarchitectonic brain mapping, and demonstrate their value for combining 3D spatial context with high-resolution 2D image data for classification. Investigating other architectures or additional model configurations (e.g. layer count, as suggested by the reviewers) is an interesting direction for future research, for which the present study provides an important basis. Another important point raised by the reviewers is the rather limited generalizability of the models to unseen brains. We agree that the performance on previously unseen brains is still not satisfactory for practical applications. In this respect, the present work confirms findings from previous studies [21,23,24] which also identified transferability to new brains as a difficult problem. However, our approach leads to a threefold improvement in performance over the baseline [21], which we consider an important contribution towards better generalizability. The reviews also included a critical remark regarding the size of the dataset used in our experiments, on which we would like to comment. Of course, the number of subjects (8 postmortem brains) is small compared to common datasets of in vivo neuroimaging, with hundreds or sometimes thousands of different brains. The acquisition of full stacks of digital whole brain sections from human brains however is incomparably more difficult and time consuming, so that only small numbers of different brains can be expected. In fact, and to the best of our knowledge, the microscopic images and annotations of cytoarchitectonic areas used in our study represent the largest dataset of this kind available today. We also want to point out that models for cytoarchitecture classification do not operate at the level of whole brains, but at the level of cortical image patches (see Fig. 1, left) sampled from different brain sections and regions, which vary considerably in texture, staining, quality and other parameters. Each such image patch is a high-resolution image of 1024-2048 squared pixels. As stated in the paper, the graph of a single brain hemisphere contains on average 1.2 million points, corresponding to the same amount of (potentially overlapping) image patches. One brain constitutes around 3 terabyte of microscopic image data. We are currently working on a cloud infrastructure to make this large dataset publicly available. back to top" />

Although the dataset is small (8 subjects) and accuracy is not high, due to the difficulties in data acquistion, the data size is actually large. Authors also plan to make this highly valuable dataset public. After you have reviewed the rebuttal, please provide your final rating based on all reviews and the authors’ rebuttal. Accept What is the rank of this paper among all your rebuttal papers? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 6 Meta-Review #3 Please provide your assessment of the paper taking all information into account, including rebuttal. Highlight the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper, clarify how you reconciled contrasting review comments and scores, indicate if concerns were successfully addressed in the rebuttal, and provide a clear justification of your decision. If you disagree with some of the (meta)reviewer statements, you can indicate so in your meta-review. Please make sure that the authors, program chairs, and the public can understand the reason for your decision. The paper proposes a graph-based learning approach to parcellate the brain surface from very high resolution histology. The used methodology extracts a mid-surface cortical mesh, learns cortical features to define surface nodal data, and learns the cytoarchitecture labeling using a graph network to exploit the geometry of the brain surface. Evaluation is on 7 brains. One reviewer appreciates exploiting 2D histology in a 3D topology approach. A second reviewer appreciates the application but questions novelty in terms of GNN. A third reviewer also highlights the new application and has minor technical questions, but blocks at a missing comparison. A fourth reviewer appreciates the application but questions low results on an unseen brain. The general consensus is on a potentially impactful application. The developed tools are mostly existing and combines them in order to leverage 2D histology in a 3D setting. The contribution is on the high resolution parcellation rather than methodological. The submission, however, emphasizes on the methodological novelty, which is less relevant in my opinion since, as pointed out by the reviewers, all components already mostly exist. Data is very small in number of subjects, however this is unreasonable to think they can acquire and label hundreds of such data. This is all well defended by the authors in their rebuttal. In my opinion, the paper should better focus on the provided data since it is really contributing towards a clinical contribution rather than an algorithmic contribution. In its current form, the paper proposes a pipeline, less interesting from a methodological aspect as noted by the reviewer, but which could lead to better brain maps. It constitutes an advancement from 2D methods in histology. For these reasons, Recommendation is toward Acceptance.

One point of criticism to which we would like to respond, was that a comparison with other state of the art methods would be missing. The state of the art is already represented in our experiments by the “base” model. It implements the method proposed in [21] (please see manuscript for references), and to the best of our knowledge is the currently best performing approach for automated cytoarchitecture classification. The only difference between our implementation (base) and [21] is the final classifier: We use an MLP in place of the linear classifier to better compare the architectures to the GNN approach. We will add a reference to [21] in the respective row of Table 2 to make this clearer. Our decision to use supervised contrastive learning (defining sample similarity based on labels) is also based on the result from [21] that contrastive learning outperforms cross-entropy training for the given task. It was furthermore noted that the GNN architectures in the proposed approach are not novel. This is correct. Our main contribution is to apply the established GNN architectures GraphSAGE and GAT to the challenging problem of cytoarchitectonic brain mapping, and demonstrate their value for combining 3D spatial context with high-resolution 2D image data for classification. Investigating other architectures or additional model configurations (e.g. layer count, as suggested by the reviewers) is an interesting direction for future research, for which the present study provides an important basis. Another important point raised by the reviewers is the rather limited generalizability of the models to unseen brains. We agree that the performance on previously unseen brains is still not satisfactory for practical applications. In this respect, the present work confirms findings from previous studies [21,23,24] which also identified transferability to new brains as a difficult problem. However, our approach leads to a threefold improvement in performance over the baseline [21], which we consider an important contribution towards better generalizability. The reviews also included a critical remark regarding the size of the dataset used in our experiments, on which we would like to comment. Of course, the number of subjects (8 postmortem brains) is small compared to common datasets of in vivo neuroimaging, with hundreds or sometimes thousands of different brains. The acquisition of full stacks of digital whole brain sections from human brains however is incomparably more difficult and time consuming, so that only small numbers of different brains can be expected. In fact, and to the best of our knowledge, the microscopic images and annotations of cytoarchitectonic areas used in our study represent the largest dataset of this kind available today. We also want to point out that models for cytoarchitecture classification do not operate at the level of whole brains, but at the level of cortical image patches (see Fig. 1, left) sampled from different brain sections and regions, which vary considerably in texture, staining, quality and other parameters. Each such image patch is a high-resolution image of 1024-2048 squared pixels. As stated in the paper, the graph of a single brain hemisphere contains on average 1.2 million points, corresponding to the same amount of (potentially overlapping) image patches. One brain constitutes around 3 terabyte of microscopic image data. We are currently working on a cloud infrastructure to make this large dataset publicly available. back to top" />

It allows to segregate the brain into cortical areas and subcortical nuclei, links structure with connectivity and function, and provides a microstructural reference for human brain atlases. Mapping boundaries between areas requires to scan histological sections at microscopic resolution. While recent high-throughput scanners allow to scan a complete human brain in the order of a year, it is practically impossible to delineate regions at the same pace using the established gold standard method. Researchers have recently addressed cytoarchitectonic mapping of cortical regions with deep neural networks, relying on image patches from individual 2D sections for classification. However, the 3D context, which is needed to disambiguate complex or obliquely cut brain regions, is not taken into account. In this work, we combine 2D histology with 3D topology by reformulating the mapping task as a node classification problem on an approximate 3D midsurface mesh through the isocortex. We extract deep features from cortical patches in 2D histological sections which are descriptive of cytoarchitecture, and assign them to the corresponding nodes on the 3D mesh to construct a large attributed graph. By solving the brain mapping problem on this graph using graph neural networks, we obtain significantly improved classification results. The proposed framework lends itself nicely to integration of additional neuroanatomical priors for mapping.

Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html It is not entirely clear if the feature encoders are the 2D approaches used prior to the proposed GNN architecture. A clearer description of this section would be beneficial. The GNN architectures all have 3 layers suggesting that the sub-graphs used have 3-hop nodes and when 5-layer is tested, 5-hop information. Comparing SAGE[5] and 7-layer network and potentially deeper networks to find the effect of depth. With both SAGE and GAT, generalizability to unseen brain, though marginal, appears to be with the shallower network while deeper is better for known images. Would this be attributed to the neighborhood? A deeper search on the neighborhood vs depth relationship would be interesting. Prior knowledge is provided to which architecture from Table 2?

Experiment is based on in-house data. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html Though the method’s performance on unseen brain is low, I think it is still useful to fill the annotation for a sparsely annotated brain. For this goal, it is desired to show result with different level of annotation sparsity. Current experiment setup did not consider this. Annotation is not sparse and the ratio between annotated and not annotated slice is fixed by 8:2. Contrastive loss is usually used for self-supervised training when sample label is not available. In proposed method, the label of sample is available. In this case, it is more straight forward to use cross entropy loss. what is the advantage and motivation of using contrastive loss here?

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Cytoarchitecture describes the spatial organization of neuronal cells in the brain, including their arrangement into layers and columns with respect to cell density, orientation, or presence of certain cell types. It allows to segregate the brain into cortical areas and subcortical nuclei, links structure with connectivity and function, and provides a microstructural reference for human brain atlases. Mapping boundaries between areas requires to scan histological sections at microscopic resolution. While recent high-throughput scanners allow to scan a complete human brain in the order of a year, it is practically impossible to delineate regions at the same pace using the established gold standard method. Researchers have recently addressed cytoarchitectonic mapping of cortical regions with deep neural networks, relying on image patches from individual 2D sections for classification. However, the 3D context, which is needed to disambiguate complex or obliquely cut brain regions, is not taken into account. In this work, we combine 2D histology with 3D topology by reformulating the mapping task as a node classification problem on an approximate 3D midsurface mesh through the isocortex. We extract deep features from cortical patches in 2D histological sections which are descriptive of cytoarchitecture, and assign them to the corresponding nodes on the 3D mesh to construct a large attributed graph. By solving the brain mapping problem on this graph using graph neural networks, we obtain significantly improved classification results. The proposed framework lends itself nicely to integration of additional neuroanatomical priors for mapping.

        <li>The GNN architectures all have 3 layers suggesting that the sub-graphs used have 3-hop nodes and when 5-layer is tested, 5-hop information. Comparing SAGE[5] and 7-layer network and potentially deeper networks to find the effect of depth.</li>
        <li>With both SAGE and GAT, generalizability to unseen brain, though marginal, appears to be with the shallower network while deeper is better for known images. Would this be attributed to the neighborhood? A deeper search on the neighborhood vs depth relationship would be interesting.</li>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Though the method’s performance on unseen brain is low, I think it is still useful to fill the annotation for a sparsely annotated brain. For this goal, it is desired to show result with different level of annotation sparsity.  Current experiment setup did not consider this. Annotation is not sparse and the ratio between annotated and not annotated slice is fixed by 8:2.
Contrastive loss is usually used for self-supervised training when sample label is not available. In proposed method, the label of sample is available. In this case, it is more straight forward to use cross entropy loss. what is the advantage and motivation of using contrastive loss here?</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The paper proposes a graph-based learning approach to parcellate the brain surface from very high resolution histology. The used methodology extracts a mid-surface cortical mesh, learns cortical features to define surface nodal data, and learns the cytoarchitecture labeling using a graph network to exploit the geometry of the brain surface. Evaluation is on 7 brains.</p>

      <p>One reviewer appreciates exploiting 2D histology in a 3D topology approach.</p>

      <p>A second reviewer appreciates the application but questions novelty in terms of GNN.</p>

      <p>A third reviewer also highlights the new application and has minor technical questions, but blocks at a missing comparison.</p>

      <p>A fourth reviewer appreciates the application but questions low results on an unseen brain.</p>

      <p>The general consensus is on a potentially impactful application. The developed tools are mostly existing and combines them in order to leverage 2D histology in a 3D setting. The contribution is on the high resolution parcellation rather than methodological. The submission, however, emphasizes on the methodological novelty, which is less relevant in my opinion since, as pointed out by the reviewers, all components already mostly exist. Data is very small in number of subjects, however this is unreasonable to think they can acquire and label hundreds of such data. This is all well defended by the authors in their rebuttal. In my opinion, the paper should better focus on the provided data since it is really contributing towards a clinical contribution rather than an algorithmic contribution. In its current form, the paper proposes a pipeline, less interesting from a methodological aspect as noted by the reviewer, but which could lead to better brain maps. It constitutes an advancement from 2D methods in histology.</p>

      <p>For these reasons, Recommendation is toward Acceptance.</p>

  <p>We thank the reviewers for investing their time and expertise into the reviews.</p>

  <p>One point of criticism to which we would like to respond, was that a comparison with other state of the art methods would be missing. The state of the art is already represented in our experiments by the “base” model. It implements the method proposed in [21] (please see manuscript for references), and to the best of our knowledge is the currently best performing approach for automated cytoarchitecture classification. The only difference between our implementation (base) and [21] is the final classifier: We use an MLP in place of the linear classifier to better compare the architectures to the GNN approach. We will add a reference to [21] in the respective row of Table 2 to make this clearer.
Our decision to use <em>supervised</em> contrastive learning (defining sample similarity based on labels) is also based on the result from [21] that contrastive learning outperforms cross-entropy training for the given task.</p>

  <p>It was furthermore noted that the GNN architectures in the proposed approach are not novel. This is correct. Our main contribution is to apply the established GNN architectures GraphSAGE and GAT to the challenging problem of cytoarchitectonic brain mapping, and demonstrate their value for combining 3D spatial context with high-resolution 2D image data for classification. Investigating other architectures or additional model configurations (e.g. layer count, as suggested by the reviewers) is an interesting direction for future research, for which the present study provides an important basis.</p>

  <p>Another important point raised by the reviewers is the rather limited generalizability of the models to unseen brains. We agree that the performance on previously unseen brains is still not satisfactory for practical applications. In this respect, the present work confirms findings from previous studies [21,23,24] which also identified transferability to new brains as a difficult problem. However, our approach leads to a threefold improvement in performance over the baseline [21], which we consider an important contribution towards better generalizability.</p>

  <p>The reviews also included a critical remark regarding the size of the dataset used in our experiments, on which we would like to comment. Of course, the number of subjects (8 postmortem brains) is small compared to common datasets of in vivo neuroimaging, with hundreds or sometimes thousands of different brains. The acquisition of full stacks of digital whole brain sections from human brains however is incomparably more difficult and time consuming, so that only small numbers of different brains can be expected. In fact, and to the best of our knowledge, the microscopic images and annotations of cytoarchitectonic areas used in our study represent the largest dataset of this kind available today. We also want to point out that models for cytoarchitecture classification do not operate at the level of whole brains, but at the level of cortical image patches (see Fig. 1, left) sampled from different brain sections and regions, which vary considerably in texture, staining, quality and other parameters. Each such image patch is a high-resolution image of 1024-2048 squared pixels. As stated in the paper, the graph of a single brain hemisphere contains on average 1.2 million points, corresponding to the same amount of (potentially overlapping) image patches. One brain constitutes around 3 terabyte of microscopic image data.
We are currently working on a cloud infrastructure to make this large dataset publicly available.</p>
