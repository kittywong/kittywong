Nguyen, Minh-Triet Tran Abstract Polyps detection plays an important role in colonoscopy, cancer diagnosis and early treatment. Many efforts have been made to improve the encoder-decoder framework using global feature with an attention mechanism to enhance local feature, helping to effectively segment diversity polyps. However, using only global information derived from the last encoder block leads to the loss of regional information from intermediate layers. Furthermore, defining the boundaries of some polyps is challenging because there is visual interference between the benign region and the polyps at the border. To address these problems, we propose two novel modules: the Cascading Context module (CCM) and the Attention Balance module (BAM), aiming to build an effective polyp segmentation model. Specifically, CCM combines the extracted regional information of the current layer and the lower layer, then pours it into the upper layer - fusing regional and global information analogous to a waterfall pattern. The BAM uses the prediction output of the adjacent lower layer as a guide map to implement the attention mechanism for the three regions separately: the background, polyp, and boundary curve. BAM enhances local context information when deriving features from the encoder block. Our proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with six evaluation metrics for segmentation quality and gives competitive results compared to other advanced methods, for both accuracy and efficiency. We shall release our code upon acceptance.

Below are our answers (A) to the comments (Q). Reviewer #1 Q: Several abbreviations seem to be used without definitions. A: Thank you very much. All abbreviations will be fully reviewed and defined in the final version. Q: What is the purpose of enhancing the background of polyps? A: Thank you. Enhancing the background of polyps drives the segmentation network to sequentially discover new and complement object regions by erasing the previously detected salient regions in an adversarial manner. As in a regular segmentation framework, the predicted map is a rough segmentation result. Thus there are some parts of the polyp that have not been fully segmented. By erasing the segmented polyp region with high confidence and then joining the attention mechanism in its upper layer, the discriminative regions have been removed and no longer contribute to the segmentation prediction; the network is naturally driven to discover new regions. Another reason for background attention is that we want to solve the segmentation problem based on multiple tasks. The task of well-distinguishing the background through the attention mechanism is also helpful in some way to the polyp segmentation task. Q: This paper presents two novel modules: the cascading context module (CCM) and the attention balance module (BAM). The experimental results prove that both modules can improve the performance of Polyp segmentation. A: Thank you for the positive comments. Reviewer #2 Q: The idea of combining the global context and the regional context information is well-motivated. A: Thank you very much. Q: There is no ablation study to show the effectiveness of background, foreground, and boundary curves in BAM. A: We will include the suggested study in the final version. Thank you very much. Reviewer #3 Q: Regarding the novelty A: Thank you. As mentioned and also recognized by other reviewers, our two proposed modules, CCM and BAM, are well-motivated and elegantly complementary. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed work. We would like to emphasize the novelty of the two proposed modules as follows. Cascading Context Module (CCM) refers to two new ideas. First, CCM proposes the concept of regional context information at the intermediate layers, which has not been mentioned in previous studies. Global context information can be useful for segmenting large polyps, but regional context information is more useful for small polyps. Here, the global context contains the features of the entire image; however, the small polyps occupy only a small region in the image. Second, CCM proposed a new way to effectively combine the global context and the regional context information. The current approaches use only global context information derived from the last encoder block may lead to ignoring some useful information of the intermediate encoder layers. In contrast, the CCM module can capture the global context and the regional context derived from E-Blocks of all deeper layers. In this way, the context information of regions in the image is weighted more precisely. Attention Balance Module (BAM) performs as a general attention mechanism. The current approaches focus only on a regional semantic concept for the attention mechanism by using only either background or boundary. In contrast, BAM uses the background and boundary and extends the attention mechanism on the third region of interest that is the foreground. These three regions cover all the semantic space of the entire image. Therefore directing attention to individual regions will help strengthen the discriminative regions leading to a more accurate segmentation. BAM proposed a new approach that has not been mentioned in previous studies to implement separately and balances the attention mechanism for all three regions to learn a better feature representation. back to top" />

Nguyen, Minh-Triet Tran Abstract Polyps detection plays an important role in colonoscopy, cancer diagnosis and early treatment. Many efforts have been made to improve the encoder-decoder framework using global feature with an attention mechanism to enhance local feature, helping to effectively segment diversity polyps. However, using only global information derived from the last encoder block leads to the loss of regional information from intermediate layers. Furthermore, defining the boundaries of some polyps is challenging because there is visual interference between the benign region and the polyps at the border. To address these problems, we propose two novel modules: the Cascading Context module (CCM) and the Attention Balance module (BAM), aiming to build an effective polyp segmentation model. Specifically, CCM combines the extracted regional information of the current layer and the lower layer, then pours it into the upper layer - fusing regional and global information analogous to a waterfall pattern. The BAM uses the prediction output of the adjacent lower layer as a guide map to implement the attention mechanism for the three regions separately: the background, polyp, and boundary curve. BAM enhances local context information when deriving features from the encoder block. Our proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with six evaluation metrics for segmentation quality and gives competitive results compared to other advanced methods, for both accuracy and efficiency. We shall release our code upon acceptance.

The Cascading Context Module can effectively combine the global context and the regional context information, which provides the ability to enable multi-scale receptive fields to help enhance the consistency of pixel-wise segmentation. In addition, the Balancing Attention Module performs as an attention machine leading to a better feature representation. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The paper designs two interactional modules among different layers in UNet-style frameworks for segmentation. Although the method achieves a good performance.

Below are our answers (A) to the comments (Q). Reviewer #1 Q: Several abbreviations seem to be used without definitions. A: Thank you very much. All abbreviations will be fully reviewed and defined in the final version. Q: What is the purpose of enhancing the background of polyps? A: Thank you. Enhancing the background of polyps drives the segmentation network to sequentially discover new and complement object regions by erasing the previously detected salient regions in an adversarial manner. As in a regular segmentation framework, the predicted map is a rough segmentation result. Thus there are some parts of the polyp that have not been fully segmented. By erasing the segmented polyp region with high confidence and then joining the attention mechanism in its upper layer, the discriminative regions have been removed and no longer contribute to the segmentation prediction; the network is naturally driven to discover new regions. Another reason for background attention is that we want to solve the segmentation problem based on multiple tasks. The task of well-distinguishing the background through the attention mechanism is also helpful in some way to the polyp segmentation task. Q: This paper presents two novel modules: the cascading context module (CCM) and the attention balance module (BAM). The experimental results prove that both modules can improve the performance of Polyp segmentation. A: Thank you for the positive comments. Reviewer #2 Q: The idea of combining the global context and the regional context information is well-motivated. A: Thank you very much. Q: There is no ablation study to show the effectiveness of background, foreground, and boundary curves in BAM. A: We will include the suggested study in the final version. Thank you very much. Reviewer #3 Q: Regarding the novelty A: Thank you. As mentioned and also recognized by other reviewers, our two proposed modules, CCM and BAM, are well-motivated and elegantly complementary. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed work. We would like to emphasize the novelty of the two proposed modules as follows. Cascading Context Module (CCM) refers to two new ideas. First, CCM proposes the concept of regional context information at the intermediate layers, which has not been mentioned in previous studies. Global context information can be useful for segmenting large polyps, but regional context information is more useful for small polyps. Here, the global context contains the features of the entire image; however, the small polyps occupy only a small region in the image. Second, CCM proposed a new way to effectively combine the global context and the regional context information. The current approaches use only global context information derived from the last encoder block may lead to ignoring some useful information of the intermediate encoder layers. In contrast, the CCM module can capture the global context and the regional context derived from E-Blocks of all deeper layers. In this way, the context information of regions in the image is weighted more precisely. Attention Balance Module (BAM) performs as a general attention mechanism. The current approaches focus only on a regional semantic concept for the attention mechanism by using only either background or boundary. In contrast, BAM uses the background and boundary and extends the attention mechanism on the third region of interest that is the foreground. These three regions cover all the semantic space of the entire image. Therefore directing attention to individual regions will help strengthen the discriminative regions leading to a more accurate segmentation. BAM proposed a new approach that has not been mentioned in previous studies to implement separately and balances the attention mechanism for all three regions to learn a better feature representation. back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<p>Polyps detection plays an important role in colonoscopy, cancer diagnosis and early treatment. Many efforts have been made to improve the encoder-decoder framework using global feature with an attention mechanism to enhance local feature, helping to effectively segment diversity polyps. However, using only global information derived from the last encoder block leads to the loss of regional information from intermediate layers. Furthermore, defining the boundaries of some polyps is challenging because there is visual interference between the benign region and the polyps at the border. To address these problems, we propose two novel modules: the Cascading Context module (CCM) and the Attention Balance module (BAM), aiming to build an effective polyp segmentation model. Specifically, CCM combines the extracted regional information of the current layer and the lower layer, then pours it into the upper layer - fusing regional and global information analogous to a waterfall pattern. The BAM uses the prediction output of the adjacent lower layer as a guide map to implement the attention mechanism for the three regions separately: the background, polyp, and boundary curve. BAM enhances local context information when deriving features from the encoder block. Our proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with six evaluation metrics for segmentation quality and gives competitive results compared to other advanced methods, for both accuracy and efficiency. We shall release our code upon acceptance.

  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Cascading Context module (CCM) and the Attention Balance module (BAM) are proposed aiming to build an effective polyp segmentation model. Specifically, CCM combines the extracted regional information of the current layer and the lower layer, then pours it into the upper layer - fusing regional and global information analogous to waterfall patterns. The BAM uses the prediction output of the adjacent lower layer as a guide map to implement the attention mechanism for the three regions separately: the background, polyp, and boundary curve. BAM enhances local context information when deriving features from the encoder block.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We thank all Reviewers and Area Chair for the positive and constructive comments. Below are our answers (A) to the comments (Q).</p>

  <p>Reviewer #1
Q: Several abbreviations seem to be used without definitions.
A: Thank you very much. All abbreviations will be fully reviewed and defined in the final version.</p>

  <p>Q: What is the purpose of enhancing the background of polyps? 
A: Thank you. Enhancing the background of polyps drives the segmentation network to sequentially discover new and complement object regions by erasing the previously detected salient regions in an adversarial manner. As in a regular segmentation framework, the predicted map is a rough segmentation result. Thus there are some parts of the polyp that have not been fully segmented. By erasing the segmented polyp region with high confidence and then joining the attention mechanism in its upper layer, the discriminative regions have been removed and no longer contribute to the segmentation prediction; the network is naturally driven to discover new regions. Another reason for background attention is that we want to solve the segmentation problem based on multiple tasks. The task of well-distinguishing the background through the attention mechanism is also helpful in some way to the polyp segmentation task.</p>

  <p>Q: This paper presents two novel modules: the cascading context module (CCM) and the attention balance module (BAM). The experimental results prove that both modules can improve the performance of Polyp segmentation.
A: Thank you for the positive comments.</p>

  <p>Reviewer #2
Q: The idea of combining the global context and the regional context information is well-motivated.
A: Thank you very much.</p>

  <p>Q: There is no ablation study to show the effectiveness of background, foreground, and boundary curves in BAM.
A: We will include the suggested study in the final version. Thank you very much.</p>

  <p>Reviewer #3
Q: Regarding the novelty
A: Thank you. As mentioned and also recognized by other reviewers, our two proposed modules, CCM and BAM, are well-motivated and elegantly complementary. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed work. We would like to emphasize the novelty of the two proposed modules as follows.</p>

  <p>Cascading Context Module (CCM) refers to two new ideas. First, CCM proposes the concept of regional context information at the intermediate layers, which has not been mentioned in previous studies. Global context information can be useful for segmenting large polyps, but regional context information is more useful for small polyps. Here, the global context contains the features of the entire image; however, the small polyps occupy only a small region in the image. Second, CCM proposed a new way to effectively combine the global context and the regional context information. The current approaches use only global context information derived from the last encoder block may lead to ignoring some useful information of the intermediate encoder layers. In contrast, the CCM module can capture the global context and the regional context derived from E-Blocks of all deeper layers. In this way, the context information of regions in the image is weighted more precisely.</p>

  <p>Attention Balance Module (BAM) performs as a general attention mechanism. The current approaches focus only on a regional semantic concept for the attention mechanism by using only either background or boundary. In contrast, BAM uses the background and boundary and extends the attention mechanism on the third region of interest that is the foreground. These three regions cover all the semantic space of the entire image. Therefore directing attention to individual regions will help strengthen the discriminative regions leading to a more accurate segmentation. BAM proposed a new approach that has not been mentioned in previous studies to implement separately and balances the attention mechanism for all three regions to learn a better feature representation.</p>
