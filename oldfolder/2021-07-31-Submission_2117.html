<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Ultrasound probe calibration remains an area of active research, but the science of validation has not received proportional attention in current literature. In this paper, we propose a framework to improve, assess, and visualize the quality of probe calibration. The basis of our framework is a heteroscedastic fiducial localization error (FLE) model that is physically quantifiable, used to i) derive an optimal calibration transform in the presence of heteroscedastic FLE, ii) assess the quality of a particular instance of probe calibration using a registration circuit, and iii) visualize the distribution of target registration error (TRE). The novelty of our work is the extension of the registration circuit to Procrustean point-line registration, and a demonstration that it produces a quantitative metric that correlates with true TRE. By treating ultrasound calibration as a heteroscedastic errors-in-variables regression instead of a least-squares regression, a more accurate calibration can be consistently obtained. Our framework has direct implication to many calibration techniques using point- and line-based calibration phantoms</p>

<p>This paper was overestimated by Reviewers 2 and 3 who did not mention what’re exactly the main strengthens of this paper in their reviews. Reviewer 4 raised some weakness and questions. From my point of view, I agree reviewer 4 that US calibration is a classical problem currently so many publications deal with. The authors just extended the current Procrustean point-line registration method. In this respect, the technical novelty was limited. On the other hand, the calibration method involves much manual interaction. This meta-reviewer would question what’re the advantages of the proposed method. Moreover, the experiment results were insufficient, particularly, there’re no any comparison to currently available US calibration methods in this paper. Additionally, what’s the clinical requirement of US calibration in surgical procedures? Some of current US calibration methods work quite well so far.</p>

<p>We thank reviewers for their insightful reviews. Our paper is indeed very dense (R2), as such may obscure readers from different community (R2) to fully appreciate the innovation (R2) and deep insights (R2/R3) we hope to convey to the CAI community. In addition to be written to be instructive (R2) with clarity (R2/R3/R4), we will also release an open-source implementation to facilitate the integration of our framework to other Procrustean registrations (R2) in CAI.</p>

<p>We clarify that we are not introducing “yet another” ultrasound (US) probe calibration technique (R3/R4/AC). Instead, we propose a framework to quantitatively assess the fitness of a calibration. As suggested by the title of our paper, and the 1st two sentences of the abstract, we advance the “science of validation” by correctly accounting for heteroscedastic FLE (R2/R3/R4), used to 1) improve, 2) assess, and 3) visualize calibration quality. We formulated a quantitative metric for an instance of calibration, shown to correlate with true TRE via an extensive Monte Carlo simulation (R2/R3), without the need to perform extensive validation experiments ([15,22,23]). Our approach uniquely differs from TRE error propagation techniques that provide an “expected” TRE for registration problems under specific classes of FLE ([3,6,9,10,19]). Our strength (AC) is the universal applicability to all US probe calibration techniques based on Procrustean (point- and line-based) registration, which are the dominant methods in the current literature ([3,5,15,16,17,18,22,23,24,25,27,28], page 8). Our novel contributions (AC) are the extension of [20,21] to line-based HEIV and extension of [7,8] to a line-based Registration Circuit. Our novel incorporation of heteroscedastic FLE (R2/R3/R4) improves the calibration quality for all Procrustean-based methods (R3). It has further implication including image registration (R2), and opens a new path for finding a solution to the fundamental problem (R2).</p>

<p>As our method is not data-driven (R2), but is rather a framework and not an concrete manifestation of a calibration technique, it would be improper to compare our framework against a known calibration technique (AC). As we discussed comprehensively in page 2, “while an instance of the probe calibration can be validated against a known calibration obtained via an alternative means, it is difficult to separate contribution of errors between the calibration approach to be validated from the calibration technique against which is being compared”, and “As is the case for every registration problem, such a ground truth calibration may never be obtained”. The issues of Target Localization Error (TLE) and unknown ground truth are exactly the compounding motivations for our work. We believe a simulation-based validation, drawn from real calibration data, is more appropriate to demonstrate the framework.</p>

<p>Demonstration of this framework as described in our paper relies on manual US fiducial segmentation and bounding box placement, used as a surrogate for FLE. We discussed how this issue may be automated ([13], page 8), and in fact, presented an automatic US needle segmentation method for this exact purpose (un-cited), and we are currently developing a fully-automatic, video-based, US probe calibration technique. We separate our theoretical contribution (this MICCAI paper) from concrete manifestation of our framework (in preparation) because our framework has wider implication to all Procrustean based methods.</p>

<p>Re: R3’s comments on bounding box alignment and beam profile: such bounding-box placements need not to be axis-aligned: when oblique, our framework is capable to account for full variance-covariance matrices. Ultrasound beam profile in the sagittal plane is concave, thinnest at the focal region and wider at the proximal/distal end ([3,22]), contributing to heteroscedastic FLE.</p>
