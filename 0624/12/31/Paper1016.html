<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Aleksandr Belov, Joël Stadelmann, Sergey Kastryulin, Dmitry V. Dylov Abstract We went below the MRI acceleration factors (a.k.a., k-space undersampling) reported by all published papers that reference the original fastMRI challenge, and then used deep learning based image enhancement methods to compensate for the underresolved images. We thoroughly study the influence of the sampling patterns, the undersampling and the downscaling factors, as well as the recovery models on the final image quality for both the brain and the knee fastMRI benchmarks. The quality of the reconstructed images compares favorably against other methods, yielding an MSE of 0.00114, a PSNR of 29.6 dB, and an SSIM of 0.956 at x16 acceleration factor. More extreme undersampling factors of x32 and x64 are also investigated, holding promise for certain clinical applications such as computer-assisted surgery or radiation planning. We survey 5 expert radiologists to assess 100 pairs of images and show that the recovered undersampled images statistically preserve their diagnostic value.

Their method is based in taking images reconstructed with undersampled k-space data to generate high-resolution images. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. One major strength of this paper is the completeness of evaluation metrics. These include images for the reader, metrics and numerical evaluation with 5 clinical reviewers. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The main limitation is the somewhat reduced set of algortithms tested. Here the authors use two HR reconstruction networks, plus 3 configurations of the latter. The comparison would be more interesting if it included alternative approaches or compared to reconstruction methods from raw k-space data. Another limitation is the lack of real data to evaluate the results. The current experiment includes only synthetic downsampling. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Very Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The description provided in the paper (combined with the appropriate citations of the methods) seems sufficient to reproduce the results. Moreover, the synthetic data used is available online. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html This is an interesting comparison between alternative approaches. For a longer paper it should be extended with validation with real data from prospective experiments and incorporate comparison to other methods. Please state your overall opinion of the paper accept (8) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? This paper provides a comparison between alternate configurations for reconstruction of HR images. The results reported are specific to the networks presented here, but yet worthy of publication.

Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. I have the following comments: The authors did not included the state-of-the-art DL MRI recon methods in their comparison which made the claims somewhat unjustified. The simulation of non Cartesian subsampling sampling patterns was very limited and not realistic. This simulation has only limited representation of any real non Cartesian k-space image quality. Therefore the claims on feasibility in extreme k-space undersampling was not justified. The radiologist’s assessments were performed using the radial mask. However, as they are not representative as to real MRI data acquisition. I have significant concerns with the validity of any results coming out from this.

Summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper and justify your recommendation. In case you deviate from the reviewers’ recommendations, explain in detail the reasons why. In case of an invitation for rebuttal, clarify which points are important to address in the rebuttal. Reviewers saw the examination of extreme acceleration in MR acquisition as interesting and important. The evaluation of the approaches, particularly the involvement of clinical reviewers, was viewed as a strength. Weaknesses cited by the reviewers were that the paper focused on a relatively limited comparison of algorithms and the fact that only synthetically resampled k-space data was used as opposed to real data. One reviewer raised concerns that this resampling was not realistic for MRI acquisition, but this concern was not shared by the other reviewers. What is the ranking of this paper in your stack? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 3 Author Feedback We thank reviewers for their valuable feedback and for pointing out the items which we can improve. We will address here two main concerns and will address the minor issues in the camera-ready. Synthetic sampling. The paradigm of synthetic “acceleration” in MR acquisition is well established in compressed sensing field, where the full k-space is a standard starting point. Given that one also knows the real k-space sampling trajectories that an MR machine can support, this is a valid and a commonly accepted workaround to gauge the performance of image reconstruction algorithms (supported by the related work referenced herein). The strategy to compensate for the artifacts, especially in the extreme undersampling case, by virtue of image space superresolution models is the focus of our work. Additional algorithms to compare against. We have considered three image-to-image models, three sampling strategies, and two downscaling sequences. We believe this results in a rather dense paper with a large number of experiments as is, especially given the short format of MICCAI paper. We hope the reviewers appreciate the very idea and the proof-of-principle of applying the most popular models to the artefactual data (SRGAN, Pix2Pix, U-Net). Obviously, the super-resolution field is very diverse on its own and considering other, perhaps more powerful, models is a sound way forward, which will be the subject of future work. back to top" />

Summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper and justify your recommendation. In case you deviate from the reviewers’ recommendations, explain in detail the reasons why. In case of an invitation for rebuttal, clarify which points are important to address in the rebuttal. Reviewers saw the examination of extreme acceleration in MR acquisition as interesting and important. The evaluation of the approaches, particularly the involvement of clinical reviewers, was viewed as a strength. Weaknesses cited by the reviewers were that the paper focused on a relatively limited comparison of algorithms and the fact that only synthetically resampled k-space data was used as opposed to real data. One reviewer raised concerns that this resampling was not realistic for MRI acquisition, but this concern was not shared by the other reviewers. What is the ranking of this paper in your stack? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 3 Author Feedback We thank reviewers for their valuable feedback and for pointing out the items which we can improve. We will address here two main concerns and will address the minor issues in the camera-ready. Synthetic sampling. The paradigm of synthetic “acceleration” in MR acquisition is well established in compressed sensing field, where the full k-space is a standard starting point. Given that one also knows the real k-space sampling trajectories that an MR machine can support, this is a valid and a commonly accepted workaround to gauge the performance of image reconstruction algorithms (supported by the related work referenced herein). The strategy to compensate for the artifacts, especially in the extreme undersampling case, by virtue of image space superresolution models is the focus of our work. Additional algorithms to compare against. We have considered three image-to-image models, three sampling strategies, and two downscaling sequences. We believe this results in a rather dense paper with a large number of experiments as is, especially given the short format of MICCAI paper. We hope the reviewers appreciate the very idea and the proof-of-principle of applying the most popular models to the artefactual data (SRGAN, Pix2Pix, U-Net). Obviously, the super-resolution field is very diverse on its own and considering other, perhaps more powerful, models is a sound way forward, which will be the subject of future work. back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>We went below the MRI acceleration factors (a.k.a., k-space undersampling) reported by all published papers that reference the original fastMRI challenge, and then used deep learning based image enhancement methods to compensate for the underresolved images. We thoroughly study the influence of the sampling patterns, the undersampling and the downscaling factors, as well as the recovery models on the final image quality for both the brain and the knee fastMRI benchmarks. The quality of the reconstructed images compares favorably against other methods, yielding an MSE of 0.00114, a PSNR of 29.6 dB, and an SSIM of 0.956 at x16 acceleration factor. More extreme undersampling factors of x32 and x64 are also investigated, holding promise for certain clinical applications such as computer-assisted surgery or radiation planning. We survey 5 expert radiologists to assess 100 pairs of images and show that the recovered undersampled images statistically preserve their diagnostic value.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The authors present a comparison of different combinations of Deep-learning based super-resolution for MR image reconstruction. Their method is based in taking images reconstructed with undersampled k-space data to generate high-resolution images.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>One major strength of this paper is the completeness of evaluation metrics. These include images for the reader, metrics and numerical evaluation with 5 clinical reviewers.</p>

    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The main limitation is the somewhat reduced set of algortithms tested. Here the authors use two HR reconstruction networks, plus 3 configurations of the latter. The comparison would be more interesting if it included alternative approaches or compared to reconstruction methods from raw k-space data.</p>

      <p>Another limitation is the lack of real data to evaluate the results. The current experiment includes only synthetic downsampling.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Very Good</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The description provided in the paper (combined with the appropriate citations of the methods) seems sufficient to reproduce the results. Moreover, the synthetic data used is available online.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: <a href="https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html">https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html</a></strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is an interesting comparison between alternative approaches. For a longer paper it should be extended with validation with real data from prospective experiments and incorporate comparison to other methods.</p>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper?</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This paper provides a comparison between alternate configurations for reconstruction of HR images. The results reported are specific to the networks presented here, but yet worthy of publication.  The study is complete and well rounded with different analysis metrics, although it would benefit from real data.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The paper used DL for accelerated MRI reconstruction and evaluated their performance based on expert opinion from 5 radiologists.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The main contribution of this paper is the experimental work and with radiologists’ evaluation of the performance of DL for accelerated MRI reconstruction. The authors also claim their best model outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</p>

    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I have the following comments:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The authors did not included the state-of-the-art DL MRI recon methods in their comparison which made the claims somewhat unjustified.</li>
        <li>The simulation of non Cartesian subsampling sampling patterns was very limited and not realistic. This simulation has only limited representation of any real non Cartesian k-space image quality. Therefore the claims on feasibility in extreme k-space undersampling was not justified.</li>
        <li>The radiologist’s assessments were performed using the radial mask. However, as they are not representative as to real MRI data acquisition. I have significant concerns with the validity of any results coming out from this.</li>
      </ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>We thank reviewers for their valuable feedback and for pointing out the items which we can improve.
We will address here two main concerns and will address the minor issues in the camera-ready.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Synthetic sampling. The paradigm of synthetic “acceleration” in MR acquisition is well established in compressed sensing field, where the full k-space is a standard starting point. Given that one also knows the real k-space sampling trajectories that an MR machine can support, this is a valid and a commonly accepted workaround to gauge the performance of image reconstruction algorithms (supported by the related work referenced herein). The strategy to compensate for the artifacts, especially in the extreme undersampling case, by virtue of image space superresolution models is the focus of our work.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Additional algorithms to compare against. We have considered three image-to-image models, three sampling strategies, and two downscaling sequences. We believe this results in a rather dense paper with a large number of experiments as is, especially given the short format of MICCAI paper. We hope the reviewers appreciate the very idea and the proof-of-principle of applying the most popular models to the artefactual data (SRGAN, Pix2Pix, U-Net). Obviously, the super-resolution field is very diverse on its own and considering other, perhaps more powerful, models is a sound way forward, which will be the subject of future work.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
