Sabuncu Abstract Compressed sensing fluorescence microscopy (CS-FM) proposes a scheme whereby less measurements are collected during sensing and reconstruction is performed to recover the image. Much work has gone into optimizing the sensing and reconstruction portions separately. We propose a method of jointly optimizing both sensing and reconstruction end-to-end under a total measurement constraint, enabling learning of the optimal sensing scheme concurrently with the parameters of a neural network-based reconstruction network. We train our model on a rich dataset of confocal, two-photon, and wide-field microscopy images comprising of a variety of biological samples. We show that our method outperforms several baseline sensing schemes and a regularized regression reconstruction algorithm. Our code is publicly-available at https://github.com/alanqrwang/csfm.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Compressed sensing fluorescence microscopy (CS-FM) proposes a scheme whereby less measurements are collected during sensing and reconstruction is performed to recover the image. Much work has gone into optimizing the sensing and reconstruction portions separately. We propose a method of jointly optimizing both sensing and reconstruction end-to-end under a total measurement constraint, enabling learning of the optimal sensing scheme concurrently with the parameters of a neural network-based reconstruction network. We train our model on a rich dataset of confocal, two-photon, and wide-field microscopy images comprising of a variety of biological samples. We show that our method outperforms several baseline sensing schemes and a regularized regression reconstruction algorithm.  Our code is publicly-available at https://github.com/alanqrwang/csfm.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In the paper the authors propose to jointly learn both the optical sensing scheme and the image reconstruction in compressed sensing microscopy, which employs multiple measurements with (Hadamard) patterned illumination masks to reduce additive noise. Specifically, the papers proposes to jointly a) optimize the probability with which a certain pattern (Hadamard row) is included in the final measurements (i.e. the sensing scheme), and b) to learn the inverse transformation that yields the reconstructed image.<br />
The paper finally applies this method on a real 2D microscopy dataset and demonstrates that the jointly learned sensing scheme/reconstruction performs better than other uninformed sensing strategies/baseline reconstruction methods.</p>
