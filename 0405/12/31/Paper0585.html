Wood, Pingkun Yan Abstract Fusing intra-operative 2D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image with pre-operative 3D magnetic resonance (MR) volume to guide prostate biopsy can significantly increase the yield. However, such a multimodal 2D/3D registration problem is very challenging due to several significant obstacles such as dimensional mismatch, large modal appearance difference, and heavy computational load. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end frame-to-volume registration network (FVR-Net), which can efficiently bridge the previous research gaps by aligning a 2D TRUS frame with a 3D TRUS volume without requiring hardware tracking. The proposed FVR-Net utilizes a dual-branch feature extraction module to extract the information from TRUS frame and volume to estimate transformation parameters. To achieve efficient training and inference, we introduce a differentiable 2D slice sampling module which allows gradients backpropagating from an unsupervised image similarity loss for content correspondence learning. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed method’s superior efficiency for real-time interventional guidance with highly competitive registration accuracy.

Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. • Novel deep learning formulation to register 2D slices to a 3D volume in TRUS imaging. • Comprehensive set of ablation studies quantify and validate method design choices. • Comparison to 5 additional baseline methods is strong. • Large dataset for training (n=488) and testing (n=65). • While results do not significantly differ from the compared, conventional (non-deep learning) registration approachs, the proposed method performs in near real-time (and 80x speed up), which has high translational impact. • The paper is very well written. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. • The method address mono-modal registration of TRUS during the procedure, but does not address the fusion of pre-procedure 3D MRI to the 3D TRUS volume. • Sensitivity to parameter choices, e.g. R, is not presented. • Does not address potential non-rigid deformations during the procedure.

Non-rigid deformations do occur during the biopsy procedure, so this type of study would be interesting to see. Sec. 3.1: Are the two loss function L_trans and L_sim combined with equal weighting, e.g. L_total = L_trans + L_sim? It would interesting to see if results improved by performing a weighted linear combination. Sec. 3.2: How sensitive is the method to the choice of R (the neighboring frame range)? This seems like it could be an important parameter choice for the method. Table 1: It would be interesting to see the variance in the results shown. In particular showing mean +/- standard dev for the DistErr would be helpful to get a sense of worst-case performance.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Fusing intra-operative 2D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image with pre-operative 3D magnetic resonance (MR) volume to guide prostate biopsy can significantly increase the yield. However, such a multimodal 2D/3D registration problem is very challenging due to several significant obstacles such as dimensional mismatch, large modal appearance difference, and heavy computational load. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end frame-to-volume registration network (FVR-Net), which can efficiently bridge the previous research gaps by aligning a 2D TRUS frame with a 3D TRUS volume without requiring hardware tracking. The proposed FVR-Net utilizes a dual-branch feature extraction module to extract the information from TRUS frame and volume to estimate transformation parameters. To achieve efficient training and inference, we introduce a differentiable 2D slice sampling module which allows gradients backpropagating from an unsupervised image similarity loss for content correspondence learning. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed method’s superior efficiency for real-time interventional guidance with highly competitive registration accuracy.

  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The authors propose a deep learning method to perform 2D frame-to- 3D volume image registration (FVR-net) of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images. The network here estimates rigid transformation parameters by optimizing a similarity metric that combines ground-truth transformation measurements (from EM-tracking fusion device) and image similarity measure (intensity squared differences).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>•	Novel deep learning formulation to register 2D slices to a 3D volume in TRUS imaging.
•	Comprehensive set of ablation studies quantify and validate method design choices.
•	Comparison to 5 additional baseline methods is strong.
•	Large dataset for training (n=488) and testing (n=65).
•	While results do not significantly differ from the compared, conventional (non-deep learning) registration approachs, the proposed method performs in near real-time (and 80x speed up), which has high translational impact.
•	The paper is very well written.</p>

  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>•	The method address mono-modal registration of TRUS during the procedure, but does not address the fusion of pre-procedure 3D MRI to the 3D TRUS volume.
•	Sensitivity to parameter choices, e.g. R, is not presented.
•	Does not address potential non-rigid deformations during the procedure.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Sec. 3: It is mentioned that rigid registration is optimal for this task. In the future, it would be great to provide quantitative results to support this conclusion. For example, another ablation study that tries to register the images using affine transformations.  Non-rigid deformations do occur during the biopsy procedure, so this type of study would be interesting to see.
Sec. 3.1: Are the two loss function L_trans and L_sim combined with equal weighting, e.g. L_total = L_trans + L_sim? It would interesting to see if results improved by performing a weighted linear combination.</p>

      <p>Sec. 3.2: How sensitive is the method to the choice of R (the neighboring frame range)? This seems like it could be an important parameter choice for the method.</p>

      <p>Table 1: It would be interesting to see the variance in the results shown. In particular showing mean +/- standard dev for the DistErr would be helpful to get a sense of worst-case performance.</p>

      <p>Grammar/Typo:</p>

      <p>Sec. 3.1, p4: “while completely ignore” -&gt; “while completely ignoring”</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This paper provides a 2D/3D registration method that can potentially run in a 3D biopsy guidance system. Existing iterative registration algorithms solve an optimization problem on-the-fly which could be slow if the initialization is too far from the solution. Methods such as the proposed algorithm run in O(1) regardless of initialization with comparable accuracy.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>The clinical application is of interest to the MICCAI community.</li>
        <li>The authors provide adequate validation and comparison to existing methods (Powel + NCC).</li>

        <li>I think the authors should cite previous work in iterative registration. The authors have missed the following:</li>

      <p>[*] Khallaghi et. al., “A 2D-3D registration framework for freehand TRUS-guided prostate biopsy”, MICCAI 2015.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The prostate is an elastic organ and undergoes deformations during the biopsy session. While I understand that the scope of this work is limited to compensating prostate motion, it is unclear how these methods could be extended to non-rigid registration. Iterative registration methods can be trivially extended by changing the transformation from rigid to a parametric deformation model. The authors should discuss this in their future work.</li>
