Specifically, considering the convolutional neural network (CNN) can well describe the local spatial features, while the transformer is good at capturing the long-range semantic information due to its global information extraction ability, our generator network takes advantages of both CNN and transformer, and is designed as an architecture of EncoderCNN-Transformer-DecoderCNN. Particularly, the EncoderCNN aims to extract compact feature representations with rich spatial information by using CNN, while the Transformer targets at capturing the long-range dependencies between the features learned by the EncoderCNN. Finally, the DecoderCNN is responsible for restoring the reconstructed PET image. Moreover, to ensure the similarity of voxel-level intensities as well as the data distributions between the reconstructed image and the real image, we harness both the voxel-wise estimation error and the adversarial loss to train the generator network. Validations on the real human brain PET data show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures.

Improved results were obtained compared with the other state-of-the-arts methods. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. It is innovative to combine transformer with GAN encoder to capture long-range semantic information. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The dataset used in evaluation is too small, with only 16 subjects in total (including training and testing). The authors did not provide any detail about the PET dataset, for example, acquisition protocol and dataset descriptions. There is no information about how the low-dose images were generated and how low the doses are. Without these details, it is hard to evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance Not enough details about the dataset. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html Expand the dataset would make the paper stronger. Also please provide more details about the dataset, as stated in the weakness. In Section 2.1, for EncoderCNN, “The extracted feature maps are further processed by a convolutional layer to reduce the channel numbers.”, it seems that the reduced channel number was not reported in the paper. I suggest also adding the PSNR, SSIM and NMSE for LPET in Table 1. Please state your overall opinion of the paper reject (3) Please justify your recommendation.

To Reviewer 1: Q1: Detail about the PET data A1: The subjects in our PET dataset were administered an average of 203MBq of [18F] FDG. All data were acquired on a Siemens Biograph mRI PET-MR system. Standard- (SPET) and low-dose PET (LPET) images were acquired consecutively based on standard imaging protocols. Specifically, the SPET images were obtained in a 12-minute period within one hour of tracer injection. And the LPET scans were acquired in a 3-minute short period to simulate the acquisition at a reduced dose of radioactive trace. The simulation is equivalent to a quarter of the standard dose. PET reconstruction was carried out iteratively with the ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) method with 3 iterations, 21 subsets, and post-reconstruction filtered with a 3D Gaussian with FWHM of 2 mm. The SPET and LPET for the same subject used the same attenuation map computed by the Dixon fat-water method provided by the scanner manufacturer. Q2: The scale of PET dataset A2: Please note that, the number of subjects (16) in our dataset is comparable to that of similar works in this field, e.g., 9 subjects used in [6] in MICCAI2020. More importantly, despite 16 subjects in total, we can provide a sufficient number of samples to train a good model by extracting 729 large patches of size 64×64×64 from the whole image of size 128×128×128. Also, to enhance the stability of the model with limited samples, we used the leave-one(subject)-out cross-validation (LOOCV) strategy, i.e., the training-test procedure is repeated for 16 times while each time one subject is used in turn for testing and the other 15 subjects are for training, the averaged performance is reported to avoid potential bias. In this manner, the total training samples are increased from 15 to 10935, which is sufficient to train our model. It is also noteworthy that, despite 16 subjects, our dataset caters for the variation of both the pathology and the healthy. Q3: Report the reduced channel number A3: To reduce the computational overhead and match the channel dimension of the fixed position encoding, the extracted feature maps are further processed by a convolutional layer to reduce the channel numbers from 512 to 192. We will report the reduced channel number in the final paper. Q4: Add the PSNR, SSIM and NMSE for LPET in Table 1. A4: As suggested, we have calculated three metrics (i.e., PSNR, SSIM, NMSE) for LPET. The results show that the average quality of LPET images is 20.684 PSNR, 0.979 SSIM, and 0.053 NMSE for normal control (NC) subjects, and 21.541 PSNR, 0.976 SSIM, and 0.058 NMSE for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, respectively. We will add these results to Table 1 in the final paper. To Reviewer 2 Q5: Artifacts below the arrow in Fig. 2 A5: The artifacts below the arrow in Fig. 2 may be incurred by the low-resolution image in current paper. We will improve the quality of Fig. 2 in the final paper. Q6: The picture is too small to see the difference in detail. A6: For a clearer display we will zoom in the saliently different regions in the final paper. To Reviewer 3 Q7: Details about the implementation of other methods. A7: For a fair comparison, we had carefully tuned the hyper-parameters of the comparison methods on the same dataset and trained the networks with the same LOOCV strategy. For each network, the number of parameters is 41M for auto-context CNN, 127M for 3D-cGANs, 127M for LA-GANs, and 76M for our method, respectively. We will provide these details in Table 1 in the final paper. Q8: The differences between different results in Fig. 3 A8: To clearly see the differences among the different results in Fig. 3, we will zoom in the regions with salient differences, and provide the error maps between the reconstructed images and the corresponding real images in the final paper. back to top" />

Specifically, considering the convolutional neural network (CNN) can well describe the local spatial features, while the transformer is good at capturing the long-range semantic information due to its global information extraction ability, our generator network takes advantages of both CNN and transformer, and is designed as an architecture of EncoderCNN-Transformer-DecoderCNN. Particularly, the EncoderCNN aims to extract compact feature representations with rich spatial information by using CNN, while the Transformer targets at capturing the long-range dependencies between the features learned by the EncoderCNN. Finally, the DecoderCNN is responsible for restoring the reconstructed PET image. Moreover, to ensure the similarity of voxel-level intensities as well as the data distributions between the reconstructed image and the real image, we harness both the voxel-wise estimation error and the adversarial loss to train the generator network. Validations on the real human brain PET data show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures.

Improved results were obtained compared with the other state-of-the-arts methods. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. It is innovative to combine transformer with GAN encoder to capture long-range semantic information. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The dataset used in evaluation is too small, with only 16 subjects in total (including training and testing). The authors did not provide any detail about the PET dataset, for example, acquisition protocol and dataset descriptions. There is no information about how the low-dose images were generated and how low the doses are. Without these details, it is hard to evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance Not enough details about the dataset. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html Expand the dataset would make the paper stronger. Also please provide more details about the dataset, as stated in the weakness. In Section 2.1, for EncoderCNN, “The extracted feature maps are further processed by a convolutional layer to reduce the channel numbers.”, it seems that the reduced channel number was not reported in the paper. I suggest also adding the PSNR, SSIM and NMSE for LPET in Table 1. Please state your overall opinion of the paper reject (3) Please justify your recommendation.

To Reviewer 1: Q1: Detail about the PET data A1: The subjects in our PET dataset were administered an average of 203MBq of [18F] FDG. All data were acquired on a Siemens Biograph mRI PET-MR system. Standard- (SPET) and low-dose PET (LPET) images were acquired consecutively based on standard imaging protocols. Specifically, the SPET images were obtained in a 12-minute period within one hour of tracer injection. And the LPET scans were acquired in a 3-minute short period to simulate the acquisition at a reduced dose of radioactive trace. The simulation is equivalent to a quarter of the standard dose. PET reconstruction was carried out iteratively with the ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) method with 3 iterations, 21 subsets, and post-reconstruction filtered with a 3D Gaussian with FWHM of 2 mm. The SPET and LPET for the same subject used the same attenuation map computed by the Dixon fat-water method provided by the scanner manufacturer. Q2: The scale of PET dataset A2: Please note that, the number of subjects (16) in our dataset is comparable to that of similar works in this field, e.g., 9 subjects used in [6] in MICCAI2020. More importantly, despite 16 subjects in total, we can provide a sufficient number of samples to train a good model by extracting 729 large patches of size 64×64×64 from the whole image of size 128×128×128. Also, to enhance the stability of the model with limited samples, we used the leave-one(subject)-out cross-validation (LOOCV) strategy, i.e., the training-test procedure is repeated for 16 times while each time one subject is used in turn for testing and the other 15 subjects are for training, the averaged performance is reported to avoid potential bias. In this manner, the total training samples are increased from 15 to 10935, which is sufficient to train our model. It is also noteworthy that, despite 16 subjects, our dataset caters for the variation of both the pathology and the healthy. Q3: Report the reduced channel number A3: To reduce the computational overhead and match the channel dimension of the fixed position encoding, the extracted feature maps are further processed by a convolutional layer to reduce the channel numbers from 512 to 192. We will report the reduced channel number in the final paper. Q4: Add the PSNR, SSIM and NMSE for LPET in Table 1. A4: As suggested, we have calculated three metrics (i.e., PSNR, SSIM, NMSE) for LPET. The results show that the average quality of LPET images is 20.684 PSNR, 0.979 SSIM, and 0.053 NMSE for normal control (NC) subjects, and 21.541 PSNR, 0.976 SSIM, and 0.058 NMSE for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, respectively. We will add these results to Table 1 in the final paper. To Reviewer 2 Q5: Artifacts below the arrow in Fig. 2 A5: The artifacts below the arrow in Fig. 2 may be incurred by the low-resolution image in current paper. We will improve the quality of Fig. 2 in the final paper. Q6: The picture is too small to see the difference in detail. A6: For a clearer display we will zoom in the saliently different regions in the final paper. To Reviewer 3 Q7: Details about the implementation of other methods. A7: For a fair comparison, we had carefully tuned the hyper-parameters of the comparison methods on the same dataset and trained the networks with the same LOOCV strategy. For each network, the number of parameters is 41M for auto-context CNN, 127M for 3D-cGANs, 127M for LA-GANs, and 76M for our method, respectively. We will provide these details in Table 1 in the final paper. Q8: The differences between different results in Fig. 3 A8: To clearly see the differences among the different results in Fig. 3, we will zoom in the regions with salient differences, and provide the error maps between the reconstructed images and the corresponding real images in the final paper. back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>To obtain high-quality positron emission tomography (PET) image at low dose, this study proposes an end-to-end 3D generative adversarial network embedded with transformer, namely Transformer-GAN, to reconstruct the standard-dose PET (SPET) image from the corresponding low-dose PET (LPET) image. Specifically, considering the convolutional neural network (CNN) can well describe the local spatial features, while the transformer is good at capturing the long-range semantic information due to its global information extraction ability, our generator network takes advantages of both CNN and transformer, and is designed as an architecture of EncoderCNN-Transformer-DecoderCNN. Particularly, the EncoderCNN aims to extract compact feature representations with rich spatial information by using CNN, while the Transformer targets at capturing the long-range dependencies between the features learned by the EncoderCNN. Finally, the DecoderCNN is responsible for restoring the reconstructed PET image. Moreover, to ensure the similarity of voxel-level intensities as well as the data distributions between the reconstructed image and the real image, we harness both the voxel-wise estimation error and the adversarial loss to train the generator network. Validations on the real human brain PET data show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures.

      <p>This article proposes a method to generate the standard dose PET image from the low dose PET image. The method is based on a 3D Transformer-GAN which takes advantage of the transformer’s ability to capture long-range semantic information. The proposed framework is interesting. The weakness of the work is the size of the data, because it is small for a 3D architecture which is composed of a 3D encoder + a 3D decoder + transformer + discriminator. Despite this weak point, I propose to accept this paper.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We thank all the reviewers for their acknowledgement about our methodological contribution, and their constructive comments for further clarification.
To Reviewer 1:
Q1: Detail about the PET data
A1: The subjects in our PET dataset were administered an average of 203MBq of [18F] FDG. All data were acquired on a Siemens Biograph mRI PET-MR system. Standard- (SPET) and low-dose PET (LPET) images were acquired consecutively based on standard imaging protocols. Specifically, the SPET images were obtained in a 12-minute period within one hour of tracer injection. And the LPET scans were acquired in a 3-minute short period to simulate the acquisition at a reduced dose of radioactive trace. The simulation is equivalent to a quarter of the standard dose. PET reconstruction was carried out iteratively with the ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) method with 3 iterations, 21 subsets, and post-reconstruction filtered with a 3D Gaussian with FWHM of 2 mm. The SPET and LPET for the same subject used the same attenuation map computed by the Dixon fat-water method provided by the scanner manufacturer.</p>

  <p>Q2: The scale of PET dataset
A2: Please note that, the number of subjects (16) in our dataset is comparable to that of similar works in this field, e.g., 9 subjects used in [6] in MICCAI2020. More importantly, despite 16 subjects in total, we can provide a sufficient number of samples to train a good model by extracting 729 large patches of size 64×64×64 from the whole image of size 128×128×128. Also, to enhance the stability of the model with limited samples, we used the leave-one(subject)-out cross-validation (LOOCV) strategy, i.e., the training-test procedure is repeated for 16 times while each time one subject is used in turn for testing and the other 15 subjects are for training, the averaged performance is reported to avoid potential bias. In this manner, the total training samples are increased from 15 to 10935, which is sufficient to train our model. It is also noteworthy that, despite 16 subjects, our dataset caters for the variation of both the pathology and the healthy.</p>

  <p>Q3: Report the reduced channel number
A3: To reduce the computational overhead and match the channel dimension of the fixed position encoding, the extracted feature maps are further processed by a convolutional layer to reduce the channel numbers from 512 to 192. We will report the reduced channel number in the final paper.</p>

  <p>Q4: Add the PSNR, SSIM and NMSE for LPET in Table 1.
A4: As suggested, we have calculated three metrics (i.e., PSNR, SSIM, NMSE) for LPET. The results show that the average quality of LPET images is 20.684 PSNR, 0.979 SSIM, and 0.053 NMSE for normal control (NC) subjects, and 21.541 PSNR, 0.976 SSIM, and 0.058 NMSE for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, respectively. We will add these results to Table 1 in the final paper.</p>

  <p>To Reviewer 2
Q5: Artifacts below the arrow in Fig. 2
A5: The artifacts below the arrow in Fig. 2 may be incurred by the low-resolution image in current paper. We will improve the quality of Fig. 2 in the final paper.</p>

  <p>Q6: The picture is too small to see the difference in detail.
A6: For a clearer display we will zoom in the saliently different regions in the final paper.</p>

  <p>To Reviewer 3
Q7: Details about the implementation of other methods.
A7: For a fair comparison, we had  carefully tuned the hyper-parameters of the comparison methods on the same dataset and trained the networks with the same LOOCV strategy. For each network, the number of parameters is 41M for auto-context CNN, 127M for 3D-cGANs, 127M for LA-GANs, and 76M for our method, respectively. We will provide these details in Table 1 in the final paper.</p>

  <p>Q8: The differences between different results in Fig. 3
A8: To clearly see the differences among the different results in Fig. 3, we will zoom in the regions with salient differences, and provide the error maps between the reconstructed images and the corresponding real images in the final paper.</p>
