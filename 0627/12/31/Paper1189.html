As the problem of CT reconstruction essentially is about how to convert discrete Fourier transform in polar coordinates to its counterpart in Cartesian coordinates, this paper proposed to directly learn an interpolation scheme, modeled by a multi-scale DNN, for predicting 2D Fourier coefficients in Cartesian coordinates from the available ones in polar coordinates.

Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance A problem of this paper is that the experiments don’t report standard deviations of the methods output and don’t test the results for significance. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html The authors present a method following the less-explored Fourier-type of CT reconstruction algorithms. This is an interesting direction to explore. From the qualitative results figures I expected to see the groundtruth results but they are not shown. Please add those to judge how faithful the method recovers and preserves genuine detail. A specific comment about the fan-beam experiment: The authors state they used measurements from a “half-circle”. If that is correct this is unsufficient data for a fan-beam measurement since one needs 180 + fan_angle to reconstruct accurately from fan-beam data. If this is correct the methods try to compensate for the limited angle artifact and the sparse-view artifact simultaneously. Surprisingly this is not visible in the FBP images, but it may be obscured by the sparse-view artifacts. There are some typos: Fig. 5: LAERN instead of LEARN in the figure subtexts Fig. 6: Biliner instead of Bilinear Please state your overall opinion of the paper borderline accept (6) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? The paper presents a novel method in an underexplored direction which I find interesting.

Summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper and justify your recommendation. In case you deviate from the reviewers’ recommendations, explain in detail the reasons why.

All comments will be taken into consideration in the revision for further improvement of the paper. Response to Reviewer #1 “How the weights in eqn2 are trained, are they trained along with the CNN” The weights in eqn2 are trained by back-propagation along with the parameters in CNN. “The detail of the “Interp” block is not clear enough?” We will elaborate it more in the revision. “Why not interpolate in sinogram?” The main reason why the interpolation is done in FFT domain not sinogram comes from the concern on computational efficiency. For Fourier interpolation, the relating forward/backward operator is FFT which is more computationally efficient than the forward/backward operators involved in sinogram interpolation. “Reproducibility is low and code is not available” Due to space limitation, only important details are covered in the main manuscript. Upon the acceptance of the paper, we will setup a Github project to put the well-documented code in public domain. Response to Reviewer #2 “The hyperparameters are not well studied. For example, the performance using different numbers of K” We will study the sensitivity of K. “Code not provided” Please refer to the response to Reviewer #1 Response to Reviewer #3 “Extension to the practically relevant cone-beam geometry reconstruction difficult, except when using rebinning algorithms and not presented” We believe the proposed method can be extended to 3D reconstruction. The proposed method originates from Fourier Slice Theorem, which interpolates the Fourier domain data from polar grid to rectangular grid. In the case of 3D reconstruction, we can make use of the Generalized Fourier Slice Theorem (GFST) [1][2] to define the interpolation domain, which enable us to extend our learnable interpolation network to solve 3D reconstruction. The proposed method can be extended to Helical CT reconstruction by incorporate with GFST directly. However, for cone-beam reconstruction, we have to deal with missing data problem and then adopt the proposed method. [1] Zhao S, Yang K, Yang K.

A specific comment about the fan-beam experiment: The authors state they used measurements from a “half-circle”. If that is correct this is unsufficient data for a fan-beam measurement since one needs 180 + fan_angle to reconstruct accurately from fan-beam data. If this is correct the methods try to compensate for the limited angle artifact and the sparse-view artifact simultaneously. Surprisingly this is not visible in the FBP images, but it may be obscured by the sparse-view artifacts.

What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? The paper presents a novel method in an underexplored direction which I find interesting.

All comments will be taken into consideration in the revision for further improvement of the paper. Response to Reviewer #1 “How the weights in eqn2 are trained, are they trained along with the CNN” The weights in eqn2 are trained by back-propagation along with the parameters in CNN. “The detail of the “Interp” block is not clear enough?” We will elaborate it more in the revision. “Why not interpolate in sinogram?” The main reason why the interpolation is done in FFT domain not sinogram comes from the concern on computational efficiency. For Fourier interpolation, the relating forward/backward operator is FFT which is more computationally efficient than the forward/backward operators involved in sinogram interpolation. “Reproducibility is low and code is not available” Due to space limitation, only important details are covered in the main manuscript. Upon the acceptance of the paper, we will setup a Github project to put the well-documented code in public domain. Response to Reviewer #2 “The hyperparameters are not well studied. For example, the performance using different numbers of K” We will study the sensitivity of K. “Code not provided” Please refer to the response to Reviewer #1 Response to Reviewer #3 “Extension to the practically relevant cone-beam geometry reconstruction difficult, except when using rebinning algorithms and not presented” We believe the proposed method can be extended to 3D reconstruction. The proposed method originates from Fourier Slice Theorem, which interpolates the Fourier domain data from polar grid to rectangular grid. In the case of 3D reconstruction, we can make use of the Generalized Fourier Slice Theorem (GFST) [1][2] to define the interpolation domain, which enable us to extend our learnable interpolation network to solve 3D reconstruction. The proposed method can be extended to Helical CT reconstruction by incorporate with GFST directly. However, for cone-beam reconstruction, we have to deal with missing data problem and then adopt the proposed method. [1] Zhao S, Yang K, Yang K.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Image reconstruction in sparse view CT is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, which aims at reconstructing a high-quality image from few and noisy measurements. As a prominent tool in the recent development of CT reconstruction, deep neural network (DNN) is mostly used as a denoising post-process or a regularization sub-module in some optimization unrolling method. As the problem of CT reconstruction essentially is about how to convert discrete Fourier transform in polar coordinates to its counterpart in Cartesian coordinates, this paper proposed to directly learn an interpolation scheme, modeled by a multi-scale DNN, for predicting  2D Fourier coefficients in Cartesian coordinates from the available ones in polar coordinates. The experiments showed that, in comparison to existing DNN-based solutions, the proposed DNN-based Fourier interpolation method not only provided the state-of-the-art performance， but also is much more computationally efficient.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This paper proposes a multi-scale DNN for sparse view CT reconstruction. The input projection is first converted to a 2D spectrum in polar coordinates. Then select the lower 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, and full-spectrum respectively to feed 4 independent processing branches. Each branch contains an “Interp” and CNN layer. “Interp” uses a “learnable adaptive weighting scheme.”
The experiments showed that the proposed deep-learning-based multi-scale Fourier interpolation method not only provided state-of-the-art performance.</p>

        <li>Interpolation in spectral-domain is a challenging problem. As it is also indicated in the paper, spectral-domain is not smooth, normal interpolation doesn’t work. How the weights in eqn2 are trained, are they trained along with the CNN? The detail of the “Interp” block is not clear enough.</li>

We will elaborate it more in the revision.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>“Why not interpolate in sinogram?”
The main reason why the interpolation is done in FFT domain not sinogram comes from the concern on computational efficiency. For Fourier interpolation, the relating forward/backward operator is FFT which is more computationally efficient than the forward/backward operators involved in sinogram interpolation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>“Reproducibility is low and code is not available”
Due to space limitation, only important details are covered in the main manuscript. Upon the acceptance of the paper, we will setup a Github project to put the well-documented code in public domain.</p>

  <p>Response to Reviewer #2</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>“The hyperparameters are not well studied. For example, the performance using different numbers of K”
   We will study the sensitivity of K.</p>
    </li>

  <p>Response to Reviewer #3</p>
  <ol>
    <li>“Extension to the practically relevant cone-beam geometry reconstruction difficult, except when using rebinning algorithms and not presented”
We believe the proposed method can be extended to 3D reconstruction. The proposed method originates from Fourier Slice Theorem, which interpolates the Fourier domain data from polar grid to rectangular grid. In the case of 3D reconstruction, we can make use of the Generalized Fourier Slice Theorem (GFST) [1][2] to define the interpolation domain, which enable us to extend our learnable interpolation network to solve 3D reconstruction. The proposed method can be extended to Helical CT reconstruction by incorporate with GFST directly. However, for cone-beam reconstruction, we have to deal with missing data problem and then adopt the proposed method.</li>

    <li>“I expected to see the ground-truth but they are not shown. Please add those to judge how faithful the method recovers and preserves genuine detail”
Indeed, the ground-truth images are shown in Fig. 6 of the main manuscript.</li>
