<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Youbao Tang, Ke Yan, Jinzheng Cai, Lingyun Huang, Guotong Xie, Jing Xiao, Jingjing Lu, Gigin Lin, Le Lu Abstract Measuring lesion size is an important step to assess tumor growth and monitor disease progression and therapy response in oncology image analysis. Although it is tedious and highly time-consuming, radiologists have to work on this task by using RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) routinely and manually. Even though lesion segmentation may be the more accurate and clinically more valuable means, physicians can not manually segment lesions as now since much more heavy laboring will be required. In this paper, we present a prior-guided dual-path network (PDNet) to segment common types of lesions throughout the whole body and predict their RECIST diameters accurately and automatically. Similar to [23], a click guidance from radiologists is the only requirement. There are two key characteristics in PDNet: 1) Learning lesion-specific attention matrices in parallel from the click prior information by the proposed prior encoder, named click-driven attention; 2) Aggregating the extracted multi-scale features comprehensively by introducing top-down and bottom-up connections in the proposed decoder, named dual-path connection. Experiments show the superiority of our proposed PDNet in lesion segmentation and RECIST diameter prediction using the DeepLesion dataset and an external test set. PDNet learns comprehensive and representative deep image features for our tasks and produces more accurate results on both lesion segmentation and RECIST diameter prediction.

It uses 2 encoders, first one with just the image as input, and the second with the image, click information (distance map and binary click image) and features from the first encoder as inputs. In decoder, it uses top-down and bottom-up connections between all levels and use deep supervision to train the network. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The paper is well written. The proposed method (each technique) is clearly motivated. The ablation experiments are nice and show the contribution of each proposed technique clearly. The results are promising. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. It seem nnUNet was only trained with segmentation loss. It would have been nice to use the diameter loss as well. At present, the difference in performance of nnUNet and PDNet might be partially due to different loss functions. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance Most of the paper is quite clear. However, there are some details which are very briefly mentioned, e.g. morphological snake used for pseudo mask generation might be difficult to re-produce. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html It is unclear why exactly the stage 1 is needed. Since the user has to provide a click, which can be used to crop a large fixed sized region. Is it ONLY for dynamically selecting the cropped region size. A comment about this would be nice. It would be nice to increase the font of text in Fig. 1 “The first stage extracts the lesion of interest (LOI) by segmentation rather than detection in [21], since sometimes the detection results do not cover the lesions that we click in.” Wouldn’t expanding the bounding box slightly resolve this issue as is commonly done when further processing is to be done.

[R4] Motivation: The most related previous work [21] has two major limitations: 1) the detection based LOI (Lesion of Interest) extraction method can produce erroneous LOIs when multiple lesions are spatially close to each other; 2) the click prior information is treated equally for all lesions with different scales. In this work, to precisely alleviate these two issues, we propose 1) a segmentation based LOI extraction strategy, and 2) a prior encoder with click-driven attention to learn lesion-specific attention matrices by effectively exploring the click prior information, and 3) a decoder with dual-path connection to aggregate the multi-scale features comprehensively. With these method improvements, our empirical quantitative performance has been boosted by a coherent and consistent margin compared to [21]. We will elaborate more on the motivation at a later edition. R1 commented that the proposed method (of each technique) was clearly motivated. [R2&amp;R4] “The novelty of the framework …”: 1) As described above, our proposed method is significantly different from [21]. 2) For the decoder part, the previous work SSN (mentioned by R2) used the dual-attention and SE modules on the extracted multi-scale features. Although we also used dual-attention to build our scale-attention module, the main difference is that we proposed the new dual-path connection to aggregate the multi-scale features comprehensively. The dual-path connection brings a larger performance gain than the scale attention module. Therefore, the novelty of this work is evident, comparing to [21] and SSN. To better summarize the novelty: 1) A prior encoder with click-driven attention is built to learn lesion-specific attention matrices to improve feature representations in parallel from the click prior information, enhancing the representation ability of the extracted features (for performance improvement). 2) A new decoder is built to aggregate the multi-scale features comprehensively for better handling our tasks by introducing dual-path connection and scale-aware attention. 3) Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance of lesion segmentation and RECIST diameter prediction on both the DeepLesion test set and an external evaluation dataset. [R1] nnUNet was also trained using both the segmentation loss and the diameter prediction loss, the same as done by our model. Thus, the superior performance of PDNet is mainly due to its own feature representation learning ability. [R1] “why exactly the stage 1 is needed”: Stage 1 is used for LOI extraction. Based on the click information, it is able to adaptively extract a lesion-specific LOI where the non-lesion regions are well removed, and the lesion’s contextual information is preserved. With the extracted LOI, stage 2 can segment the lesion and predict its RECIST diameters precisely. If directly using the click to extract a LOI by cropping a large region with a fixed size, it is hard to decide how large the size we should select since the lesion sizes can vary significantly for different lesions. There are lots of non-lesion regions in the cropped region if the selected fixed size is large, which affects the performance of stage 2. Adaptively extracting a lesion-specific LOI (as done in stage 1) is better and more reliable than cropping a large region with a fixed size. [R4] “using segmentation masks for diameter prediction”: Actually, we did not get the predicted diameters from segmentation results. This work treated the lesion segmentation and diameter prediction as two different tasks and learned them jointly in a unified framework. Both results are obtained from the input CT images directly. It is, with one model, we can get accurate RECIST diameters and lesion segmentations. If stacking the 2D lesion segmentation results slice-by-slice, we can even obtain the 3D lesion volumetric segmentations (out of the scope here). back to top" />

Although it is tedious and highly time-consuming, radiologists have to work on this task by using RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) routinely and manually. Even though lesion segmentation may be the more accurate and clinically more valuable means, physicians can not manually segment lesions as now since much more heavy laboring will be required. In this paper, we present a prior-guided dual-path network (PDNet) to segment common types of lesions throughout the whole body and predict their RECIST diameters accurately and automatically. Similar to [23], a click guidance from radiologists is the only requirement. There are two key characteristics in PDNet: 1) Learning lesion-specific attention matrices in parallel from the click prior information by the proposed prior encoder, named click-driven attention; 2) Aggregating the extracted multi-scale features comprehensively by introducing top-down and bottom-up connections in the proposed decoder, named dual-path connection. Experiments show the superiority of our proposed PDNet in lesion segmentation and RECIST diameter prediction using the DeepLesion dataset and an external test set. PDNet learns comprehensive and representative deep image features for our tasks and produces more accurate results on both lesion segmentation and RECIST diameter prediction.

It uses 2 encoders, first one with just the image as input, and the second with the image, click information (distance map and binary click image) and features from the first encoder as inputs. In decoder, it uses top-down and bottom-up connections between all levels and use deep supervision to train the network. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The paper is well written. The proposed method (each technique) is clearly motivated. The ablation experiments are nice and show the contribution of each proposed technique clearly. The results are promising. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. It seem nnUNet was only trained with segmentation loss. It would have been nice to use the diameter loss as well. At present, the difference in performance of nnUNet and PDNet might be partially due to different loss functions. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance Most of the paper is quite clear. However, there are some details which are very briefly mentioned, e.g. morphological snake used for pseudo mask generation might be difficult to re-produce. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html It is unclear why exactly the stage 1 is needed. Since the user has to provide a click, which can be used to crop a large fixed sized region. Is it ONLY for dynamically selecting the cropped region size. A comment about this would be nice. It would be nice to increase the font of text in Fig. 1 “The first stage extracts the lesion of interest (LOI) by segmentation rather than detection in [21], since sometimes the detection results do not cover the lesions that we click in.” Wouldn’t expanding the bounding box slightly resolve this issue as is commonly done when further processing is to be done.

The topic is not original (but not very common), and the technical improvement is not obvious. The click-driven attention is similar to the previous work[21], and the decoder part of framework is similar to some other known work (SSN, Feng et al. ISBI, 2020). The details of the proposed modules are similar to, but not identical to the known work. -Some fragments in Fig.1 is too small to see. Please make them larger.

Motivation is not well explained Very little difference from prior/base work Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Very Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The paper appears to provide enough details to reproduce the results. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html The authors mention in the introduction that measuring the diameter of a lesion is a subjective task and more accurate and precise metrics could be derived from lesion segmentation masks. Yet the paper describes a method for diameter prediction using segmentation masks. It is unclear why this inferior metric was chosen as opposed to something more accurate and meaningful, such as volume. The method described in the paper appears to have very little difference compared to the previous/base method [21].

[R4] Motivation: The most related previous work [21] has two major limitations: 1) the detection based LOI (Lesion of Interest) extraction method can produce erroneous LOIs when multiple lesions are spatially close to each other; 2) the click prior information is treated equally for all lesions with different scales. In this work, to precisely alleviate these two issues, we propose 1) a segmentation based LOI extraction strategy, and 2) a prior encoder with click-driven attention to learn lesion-specific attention matrices by effectively exploring the click prior information, and 3) a decoder with dual-path connection to aggregate the multi-scale features comprehensively. With these method improvements, our empirical quantitative performance has been boosted by a coherent and consistent margin compared to [21]. We will elaborate more on the motivation at a later edition. R1 commented that the proposed method (of each technique) was clearly motivated. [R2&amp;R4] “The novelty of the framework …”: 1) As described above, our proposed method is significantly different from [21]. 2) For the decoder part, the previous work SSN (mentioned by R2) used the dual-attention and SE modules on the extracted multi-scale features. Although we also used dual-attention to build our scale-attention module, the main difference is that we proposed the new dual-path connection to aggregate the multi-scale features comprehensively. The dual-path connection brings a larger performance gain than the scale attention module. Therefore, the novelty of this work is evident, comparing to [21] and SSN. To better summarize the novelty: 1) A prior encoder with click-driven attention is built to learn lesion-specific attention matrices to improve feature representations in parallel from the click prior information, enhancing the representation ability of the extracted features (for performance improvement). 2) A new decoder is built to aggregate the multi-scale features comprehensively for better handling our tasks by introducing dual-path connection and scale-aware attention. 3) Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance of lesion segmentation and RECIST diameter prediction on both the DeepLesion test set and an external evaluation dataset. [R1] nnUNet was also trained using both the segmentation loss and the diameter prediction loss, the same as done by our model. Thus, the superior performance of PDNet is mainly due to its own feature representation learning ability. [R1] “why exactly the stage 1 is needed”: Stage 1 is used for LOI extraction. Based on the click information, it is able to adaptively extract a lesion-specific LOI where the non-lesion regions are well removed, and the lesion’s contextual information is preserved. With the extracted LOI, stage 2 can segment the lesion and predict its RECIST diameters precisely. If directly using the click to extract a LOI by cropping a large region with a fixed size, it is hard to decide how large the size we should select since the lesion sizes can vary significantly for different lesions. There are lots of non-lesion regions in the cropped region if the selected fixed size is large, which affects the performance of stage 2. Adaptively extracting a lesion-specific LOI (as done in stage 1) is better and more reliable than cropping a large region with a fixed size. [R4] “using segmentation masks for diameter prediction”: Actually, we did not get the predicted diameters from segmentation results. This work treated the lesion segmentation and diameter prediction as two different tasks and learned them jointly in a unified framework. Both results are obtained from the input CT images directly. It is, with one model, we can get accurate RECIST diameters and lesion segmentations. If stacking the 2D lesion segmentation results slice-by-slice, we can even obtain the 3D lesion volumetric segmentations (out of the scope here). back to top","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Measuring lesion size is an important step to assess tumor growth and monitor disease progression and therapy response in oncology image analysis. Although it is tedious and highly time-consuming, radiologists have to work on this task by using RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) routinely and manually. Even though lesion segmentation may be the more accurate and clinically more valuable means, physicians can not manually segment lesions as now since much more heavy laboring will be required. In this paper, we present a prior-guided dual-path network (PDNet) to segment common types of lesions throughout the whole body and predict their RECIST diameters accurately and automatically. Similar to [23], a click guidance from radiologists is the only requirement. There are two key characteristics in PDNet: 1) Learning lesion-specific attention matrices in parallel from the click prior information by the proposed prior encoder, named click-driven attention; 2) Aggregating the extracted multi-scale features comprehensively by introducing top-down and bottom-up connections in the proposed decoder, named dual-path connection. Experiments show the superiority of our proposed PDNet in lesion segmentation and RECIST diameter prediction using the DeepLesion dataset and an external test set. PDNet learns comprehensive and representative deep image features for our tasks and produces more accurate results on both lesion segmentation and RECIST diameter prediction.

<blockquote>
  <p>We thank all the constructive and helpful comments from both reviewers and AC.</p>

  <p>[R4] Motivation: The most related previous work [21] has two major limitations: 1) the detection based LOI (Lesion of Interest) extraction method can produce erroneous LOIs when multiple lesions are spatially close to each other; 2) the click prior information is treated equally for all lesions with different scales. In this work, to precisely alleviate these two issues, we propose 1) a segmentation based LOI extraction strategy, and 2) a prior encoder with click-driven attention to learn lesion-specific attention matrices by effectively exploring the click prior information, and 3) a decoder with dual-path connection to aggregate the multi-scale features comprehensively. With these method improvements, our empirical quantitative performance has been boosted by a coherent and consistent margin compared to [21]. We will elaborate more on the motivation at a later edition. R1 commented that the proposed method (of each technique) was clearly motivated.</p>

  <p>[R2&amp;R4] “The novelty of the framework …”: 1) As described above, our proposed method is significantly different from [21]. 2) For the decoder part, the previous work SSN (mentioned by R2) used the dual-attention and SE modules on the extracted multi-scale features. Although we also used dual-attention to build our scale-attention module, the main difference is that we proposed the new dual-path connection to aggregate the multi-scale features comprehensively. The dual-path connection brings a larger performance gain than the scale attention module. Therefore, the novelty of this work is evident, comparing to [21] and SSN. To better summarize the novelty: 1) A prior encoder with click-driven attention is built to learn lesion-specific attention matrices to improve feature representations in parallel from the click prior information, enhancing the representation ability of the extracted features (for performance improvement). 2) A new decoder is built to aggregate the multi-scale features comprehensively for better handling our tasks by introducing dual-path connection and scale-aware attention. 3) Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance of lesion segmentation and RECIST diameter prediction on both the DeepLesion test set and an external evaluation dataset.</p>

  <p>[R1] nnUNet was also trained using both the segmentation loss and the diameter prediction loss, the same as done by our model. Thus, the superior performance of PDNet is mainly due to its own feature representation learning ability.</p>

  <p>[R1] “why exactly the stage 1 is needed”: Stage 1 is used for LOI extraction. Based on the click information, it is able to adaptively extract a lesion-specific LOI where the non-lesion regions are well removed, and the lesion’s contextual information is preserved. With the extracted LOI, stage 2 can segment the lesion and predict its RECIST diameters precisely. If directly using the click to extract a LOI by cropping a large region with a fixed size, it is hard to decide how large the size we should select since the lesion sizes can vary significantly for different lesions. There are lots of non-lesion regions in the cropped region if the selected fixed size is large, which affects the performance of stage 2. Adaptively extracting a lesion-specific LOI (as done in stage 1) is better and more reliable than cropping a large region with a fixed size.</p>

  <p>[R4] “using segmentation masks for diameter prediction”: Actually, we did not get the predicted diameters from segmentation results. This work treated the lesion segmentation and diameter prediction as two different tasks and learned them jointly in a unified framework. Both results are obtained from the input CT images directly. It is, with one model, we can get accurate RECIST diameters and lesion segmentations. If stacking the 2D lesion segmentation results slice-by-slice, we can even obtain the 3D lesion volumetric segmentations (out of the scope here).</p>
