<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Yanwen Li, Luyang Luo, Huangjing Lin, Hao Chen, Pheng-Ann Heng Abstract The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterized by atypical pneumonia has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Automatically segmenting lesions from chest Computed Tomography (CT) is a promising way to assist doctors in COVID-19 screening, treatment planning, and follow-up monitoring. However, voxel-wise annotations are extremely expert-demanding and scarce, especially when it comes to novel diseases, while an abundance of unlabeled data could be available. To tackle the challenge of limited annotations, in this paper, we propose an uncertainty-guided dual-consistency learning network (UDC-Net) for semi-supervised COVID-19 lesion segmentation from CT images. Specifically, we present a dual-consistency learning scheme that simultaneously imposes image transformation equivalence and feature perturbation invariance to effectively harness the knowledge from unlabeled data. We then quantify the segmentation uncertainty in two forms and employ them together to guide the consistency regularization for more reliable unsupervised learning. Extensive experiments showed that our proposed UDC-Net improves the fully supervised method by 6.3% in Dice and outperforms other competitive semi-supervised approaches by significant margins, demonstrating high potential in real-world clinical practice.

Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The reproducibility is poor. There are several open COVID-19 segmentation datasets, the author’s motivation to ignore them is unclear. Here is the list of examples: (1) Mosmed-1110. It seems to be an excellent dataset for validating semisupervised methods as it contains 50 CTs with segmentation masks and 1000+ without masks. https://github.com/neuro-ml/COVID-19-Triage (2) Covid segmentation challenge, a MICCAI endorsed event (!). It’s quite large, so some GT masks can be removed in order to evaluate the method. https://covid-segmentation.grand-challenge.org (3) Medseg - a small but famous dataset. Maybe it can be used as an external test set in a journal version of the paper. http://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/ Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html The most important suggestion is to to improve reproducibility by sharing the code and using open datasets in addition to your private one.

It improves upon the Cross-Consistency Training model (Ouali et al., Cvpr 2020) by enforcing consistency with respect to both image transformations and feature perturbations. It further uses uncertainty estimation to improve the segmentation prediction accuracy. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The paper compares with a comprehensive list of baselines, and achieves better mean results. The proposed dual consistency and uncertainty estimation both seem helpful in terms of improving the accuracy of the predictions. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The aleatoric uncertainty mentioned in Section 2.2 seems to be epistemic. The described method is similar to MC dropout, where the injected perturbations on the input to each decoder can be viewed as the “dropout features.” Then the variance of the outputs from the decoder ensemble is similar to the variance of the Monte Carlo predictions, which quantifies model uncertainty. In other words, I think Eqs. 3 &amp; 4 are two ways to compute epistemic uncertainty. In Table 1, it is unclear why authors only show IC + FC + UE (row 6), but not IC + FC + UA?

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterized by atypical pneumonia has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Automatically segmenting lesions from chest Computed Tomography (CT) is a promising way to assist doctors in COVID-19 screening, treatment planning, and follow-up monitoring. However, voxel-wise annotations are extremely expert-demanding and scarce, especially when it comes to novel diseases, while an abundance of unlabeled data could be available. To tackle the challenge of limited annotations, in this paper, we propose an uncertainty-guided dual-consistency learning network (UDC-Net) for semi-supervised COVID-19 lesion segmentation from CT images. Specifically, we present a dual-consistency learning scheme that simultaneously imposes image transformation equivalence and feature perturbation invariance to effectively harness the knowledge from unlabeled data. We then quantify the segmentation uncertainty in two forms and employ them together to guide the consistency regularization for more reliable unsupervised learning. Extensive experiments showed that our proposed UDC-Net improves the fully supervised method by 6.3% in Dice and outperforms other competitive semi-supervised approaches by significant margins, demonstrating high potential in real-world clinical practice.

    <blockquote>
      <p>The reproducibility is poor. There are several open COVID-19 segmentation datasets, the author’s motivation to ignore them is unclear. Here is the list of examples:</p>

      <p>(1) Mosmed-1110. It seems to be an excellent dataset for validating semisupervised methods as it contains 50 CTs with segmentation masks and 1000+ without masks. https://github.com/neuro-ml/COVID-19-Triage</p>

      <p>(2) Covid segmentation challenge, a MICCAI endorsed event (!). It’s quite large, so some GT masks can be removed in order to evaluate the method. https://covid-segmentation.grand-challenge.org</p>

      <p>(3) Medseg - a small but famous dataset. Maybe it can be used as an external test set in a journal version of the paper. http://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/</p>

      <p>This paper tackles the semi-supervised semantic segmentation problem on the Covid-19 CT images. It improves upon the Cross-Consistency Training model (Ouali et al., Cvpr 2020) by enforcing consistency with respect to both image transformations and feature perturbations. It further uses uncertainty estimation to improve the segmentation prediction accuracy.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>The paper compares with a comprehensive list of baselines, and achieves better mean results.</li>
        <li>The proposed dual consistency and uncertainty estimation both seem helpful in terms of improving the accuracy of the predictions.</li>

    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>The aleatoric uncertainty mentioned in Section 2.2 seems to be epistemic. The described method is similar to MC dropout, where the injected perturbations on the input to each decoder can be viewed as the “dropout features.” Then the variance of the outputs from the decoder ensemble is similar to the variance of the Monte Carlo predictions, which quantifies model uncertainty. In other words, I think Eqs. 3 &amp; 4 are two ways to compute epistemic uncertainty.</li>
        <li>In Table 1, it is unclear why authors only show IC + FC + UE (row 6), but not IC + FC + UA?</li>
        <li>None of the results show statistical significance.</li>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Although image consistency and feature consistency are proposed by earlier work, the paper considers the two consistency together and propose an uncertainty quantification for further guiding the consistency regularization. Besides, the application of semi-supervised learning in COVID-19 lesion segmentation is valuable for the community.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The authors combine several existing methods for semi-supervised segmentation into a new one and apply it to a new application for COVID-19 lesion segmentation. All the reviewers appreciate the reasonability of the method and the better performance compared with several state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. Some details of the implementation are not clear, but the authors promised to release the code. Some minor points should be clarified, such as discussion about the uncertainty estimation method and the result of “IC+FC+UA”.</p>
