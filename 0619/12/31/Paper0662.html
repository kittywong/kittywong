Frangi, Dong Ni Abstract 3D ultrasound (US) is widely used for its rich diagnostic information. However, it is criticized for its limited field of view. 3D freehand US reconstruction is promising in addressing the problem by providing broad range and freeform scan. The existing deep learning based methods only focus on the basic cases of skill sequences, and the model relies on the training data heavily. The sequences in real clinical practice are a mix of diverse skills and have complex scanning paths. Besides, deep models should adapt themselves to the testing cases with prior knowledge for better robustness, rather than only fit to the training cases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to sensorless freehand 3D US reconstruction considering the complex skill sequences. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we advance a novel online learning framework by designing a differentiable reconstruction algorithm. It realizes an end-to-end optimization from section sequences to the reconstructed volume. Second, a self-supervised learning method is developed to explore the context information that reconstructed by the testing data itself, promoting the perception of the model. Third, inspired by the effectiveness of shape prior, we also introduce adversarial training to strengthen the learning of anatomical shape prior in the reconstructed volume. By mining the context and structural cues of the testing data, our online learning methods can drive the model to handle complex skill sequences. Experimental results on developmental dysplasia of the hip US and fetal US datasets show that, our proposed method can outperform the start-of-the-art methods regarding the shift errors and path similarities.

The authors should give more information about how the reconstructed volume is obtained from the estimated ^\u0012 The de nition of W(Dij) and softmax in (2) is confusing. The softmax of 1=(Dij + \u000fepsilon) is just 1. Is this what the authors want? For the loss function in (4), the notations of \u0012 and ^\u0012 are abused. In the loss Ld in (5), the C(Vp) is not de ned. Please state your overall opinion of the paper borderline accept (6) Please justify your recommendation.

Self-supervised learning and adversarial training were incorporated into the training and test phases, which boosts the performance of the listed evaluation metrics through the ablation study. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. 1) The proposed methodology experimentally boosted the performance over the previous work, Guo H et al (2020). Online self-supervised learning and online adversarial training are the main contributions. 2) The authors proposed the differentiable reconstruction approximation to enable an end-to-end optimisation for the learning process. 3) The proposed methodology may generalise to multiple ultrasound scan sequences, which may potentially benefit the real clinical scenario of ultrasound scans. Reference: Guo H et al: Sensorless freehand 3d ultrasound reconstruction via deep contextual learning. In MICCAI 2020. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. 1) Learning all benchmarking models on only the synthetic data may hinder the way to extend the evaluation from the simulation to the real scenario. 2) Were the baseline models, i.e. CNN [11] and DCL-Net [4], trained and fine-tuned in a rational way? Intuitively, it may be unnatural that DCL-Net with deeper architecture performed bad compared to the proposed one with one layer. 3) The title doesn’t fully reflect the main idea of this paper. 4) Fig. 4 shows still a portion of cases may overfit or diverge by using the iterative optimisation. 5) The clarity of presentation requires some more improvements to warrant publication in MICCAI. Not all the content in the paper seems self-contained, asking the readers a lot to know the specific terminologies with no references. Kindly refer to the more comments in Point 7. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance The authors have checked all items in reproducibility checklist. However, from the main text, we are unable to identify: Necessary details of the way to simulate training data; Link of the dataset; A comprehensive list of all used parameters such as batch size. How to tune the baseline models; Clear definition of the evaluation metrics, such as drift. Capacity of the used deep learning models, or memory footprint. If the author can fulfill the reproducibility checklist as promised, it is highly likely that the work can be reproduced. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html 1) The paper may win if a delicate English polish is done by a native speaker. Some English expressions like “complex scan skill sequences”, “the indicators decline curves”, etc. look vague to me. 2) Suggest prudently defining or formulating the unspecified terminologies, such as relative transform parameter, drift, the distance D_ij, the function C(.). Avoid dual definitions for the symbol L. Please state your overall opinion of the paper Probably accept (7) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? The proposed online learning framework is novel to ultrasound 3d reconstruction. It reinforces the previous work Guo H et al (2020) by adopting other architecture and training strategy. However, there is lack of intuition or theory to explain why the proposed method can outperform. Furthermore, the presentation requires a significant improvement to warrant publication.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>3D ultrasound (US) is widely used for its rich diagnostic information. However, it is criticized for its limited field of view. 3D freehand US reconstruction is promising in addressing the problem by providing broad range and freeform scan. The existing deep learning based methods only focus on the basic cases of skill sequences, and the model relies on the training data heavily. The sequences in real clinical practice are a mix of diverse skills and have complex scanning paths. Besides, deep models should adapt themselves to the testing cases with prior knowledge for better robustness, rather than only fit to the training cases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to sensorless freehand 3D US reconstruction considering the complex skill sequences. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we advance a novel online learning framework by designing a differentiable reconstruction algorithm. It realizes an end-to-end optimization from section sequences to the reconstructed volume. Second, a self-supervised learning method is developed to explore the context information that reconstructed by the testing data itself, promoting the perception of the model. Third, inspired by the effectiveness of shape prior, we also introduce adversarial training to strengthen the learning of anatomical shape prior in the reconstructed volume. By mining the context and structural cues of the testing data, our online learning methods can drive the model to handle complex skill sequences. Experimental results on developmental dysplasia of the hip US and fetal US datasets show that, our proposed method can outperform the start-of-the-art methods regarding the shift errors and path similarities.

2) The authors proposed the differentiable reconstruction approximation to enable an end-to-end optimisation for the learning process.
3) The proposed methodology may generalise to multiple ultrasound scan sequences, which may potentially benefit the real clinical scenario of ultrasound scans.</p>

  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1)	Learning all benchmarking models on only the synthetic data may hinder the way to extend the evaluation from the simulation to the real scenario.
2)	Were the baseline models, i.e. CNN [11] and DCL-Net [4], trained and fine-tuned in a rational way? Intuitively, it may be unnatural that DCL-Net with deeper architecture performed bad compared to the proposed one with one layer.
3)	The title doesn’t fully reflect the main idea of this paper.
4)	Fig. 4 shows still a portion of cases may overfit or diverge by using the iterative optimisation.
5)	The clarity of presentation requires some more improvements to warrant publication in MICCAI. Not all the content in the paper seems self-contained, asking the readers a lot to know the specific terminologies with no references. Kindly refer to the more comments in Point 7.</p>

      <p>1)	The paper may win if a delicate English polish is done by a native speaker. Some English expressions like “complex scan skill sequences”, “the indicators decline curves”, etc. look vague to me.
2)	Suggest prudently defining or formulating the unspecified terminologies, such as relative transform parameter, drift, the distance D_ij, the function C(.). Avoid dual definitions for the symbol L.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The proposed online learning framework is novel to ultrasound 3d reconstruction. It reinforces the previous work Guo H et al (2020) by adopting other architecture and training strategy. However, there is lack of intuition or theory to explain why the proposed method can outperform. Furthermore, the presentation requires a significant improvement to warrant publication.</p>
