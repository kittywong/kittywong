<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Tianchen Wang, Zhihe Li, Meiping Huang, Jian Zhuang, Shanshan Bi, Jiawei Zhang, Yiyu Shi, Hongwen Fei, Xiaowei Xu Abstract Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a potential separation between the septum, primum and septum secundum located in the anterosuperior portion of the atrial septum. PFO is one of the main factors causing cryptogenic stroke which is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. For PFO diagnosis, contrast transthoracic echocardiography (cTTE) is preferred as being a more robust method compared with others. However, the current PFO diagnosis through cTTE is extremely slow as it is proceeded manually by sonographers on echocardiography videos. Currently there is no publicly available dataset for this important topic in the community. In this paper, we present EchoCP, as the first echocardiography dataset in cTTE targeting PFO diagnosis. EchoCP consists of 30 patients with both rest and Valsalva maneuver videos which covers various PFO grades. We further establish an automated baseline method for PFO diagnosis based on the state-of-the-art cardiac chamber segmentation technique, which achieves 0.89 average mean Dice score, but only 0.70/0.67 mean accuracies for PFO diagnosis, leaving large room for improvement. We hope that the challenging EchoCP dataset can stimulate further research and lead to innovative and generic solutions that would have an impact in multiple domains. Our dataset and code are released to the public.

Moreover the authors suggest also a method to automatically evaluate this pathology. The methodology is innovative but the database stay small with only 30 cases with PFO. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. The proposed dataset is a new one, dedicated to a specific pathology, then with an important added value in the medical domain. The suggested pipeline for grading the PFO is also well-designed. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The number of cases with PFO in the dataset is very low (only 20 cases), and globally the size of the dataset is small (30 cases). We can expect more cases from a pathology that is relatively common. Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Very Good Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance No problem about the reproducibility because the dataset and the code are released to the public. However, it is not clear if the annotations are provided. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html The main drawback being the size of the dataset, they must try to increase the number of cases. Moreover, during the discussion of the results, we do not know if the wrong classification cases with VM videos are the same with rest videos. According to the authors, it is possible to consider both videos automatically to improve the diagnosis. Maybe they can also discussed about the possibility to do the diagnosis without the segmentation step (as it is done visually).

Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. Important dataset and initial code released. Highly positive. Alternative echocardiography acquisitions for each of 30 patients, multiple four-chamber annotations per video. This is a great collection of data I hope to use. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. While the automated method is described in some detail, the experimental setup is left out. I only see “we trained the model only with the labeled frames in EchoCP.” Were the patients split into training/validation/test, for example? Any kind of crossfold validation?

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a potential separation between the septum, primum and septum secundum located in the anterosuperior portion of the atrial septum. PFO is one of the main factors causing cryptogenic stroke which is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. For PFO diagnosis, contrast transthoracic echocardiography (cTTE) is preferred as being a more robust method compared with others. However, the current PFO diagnosis through cTTE is extremely slow as it is proceeded manually by sonographers on echocardiography videos. Currently there is no publicly available dataset for this important topic in the community. In this paper, we present EchoCP, as the first echocardiography dataset in cTTE targeting PFO diagnosis. EchoCP consists of 30 patients with both rest and Valsalva maneuver videos which covers various PFO grades. We further establish an automated baseline method for PFO diagnosis based on the state-of-the-art cardiac chamber segmentation technique, which achieves 0.89 average mean Dice score, but only 0.70/0.67 mean accuracies for PFO diagnosis, leaving large room for improvement. We hope that the challenging EchoCP dataset can stimulate further research and lead to innovative and generic solutions that would have an impact in multiple domains. Our dataset and code are released to the public.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please describe the contribution of the paper</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The paper present a new dataset allowing patent forament ovale (PFO) diagnosis to be done from echocardiography. Moreover the authors suggest also a method to automatically evaluate this pathology. The methodology is innovative but the database stay small with only 30 cases with PFO.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The proposed dataset is a new one, dedicated to a specific pathology, then with an important added value in the medical domain.
The suggested pipeline for grading the PFO is also well-designed.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The number of cases with PFO in the dataset is very low (only 20 cases), and globally the size of the dataset is small (30 cases). We can expect more cases from a pathology that is relatively common.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The main drawback being the size of the dataset, they must try to increase the number of cases.
Moreover, during the discussion of the results, we do not know if the wrong classification cases with VM videos are the same with rest videos. According to the authors, it is possible to consider both videos automatically to improve the diagnosis.
Maybe they can also discussed about the possibility to do the diagnosis without the segmentation step (as it is done visually).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Important dataset and initial code released. Highly positive. Alternative echocardiography acquisitions for each of 30 patients, multiple four-chamber annotations per video. This is a great collection of data I hope to use.</p>

    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>While the automated method is described in some detail, the experimental setup is left out. I only see “we trained the model only with the labeled frames in EchoCP.” Were the patients split into training/validation/test, for example? Any kind of crossfold validation? One cannot hope to compare their novel methods against the proposed baseline without these details.</p>

        <li>are the “predefined microbubble patterns” part of the released codebase</li>
        <li>more detail on the experimental setup would be appreciated in the paper.</li>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Small issues:</p>

      <p>-cryptogenic stroke which is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States – cryptogenic stroke appears to represent less than half of all stroke, and pfo-correlated stroke is even less, and separately all stroke is a leading cause of death. Could you maybe just say cryptogenic stroke which is a leading cause…</p>

      <p>-For data augmentation, even the number of available annotations is limited, we do not proceed
with a heavy augmentation – <em>since</em> the number… maybe. Sentence is confusing.</p>

      <p>-regions are not correctly detected that results in an intensity peak in LV – detected, which results in…</p>

      <p>-For the bad diagnosis examples in rest videos, although…but – the “but” is unneeded.</p>

      <p>The paper presents a new database in contrast transthoracic echocardiography for patent foramen ovaled diagnosis. Strategies for diagnosis have great interest in the clinical practice due to the complexity of the disease and quality of images.

      <p>However, the method for the diagnosis isn’t novel and it have to be better explained, with parameters to be reproducible. Some references are old, authors should update the references.
