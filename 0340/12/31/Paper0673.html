<meta name="description" content="Paper Info Reviews Meta-review(s) Author Feedback Authors Sebastian Pölsterl, Christina Aigner, Christian Wachinger Abstract Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have an enormous potential to learn from complex biomedical data. In particular, DNNs have been used to seamlessly fuse heterogeneous information from neuroanatomy, genetics, biomarkers, and neuropsychological tests for highly accurate Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis. On the other hand, their black-box nature is still a barrier for the adoption of such a system in the clinic, where interpretability is absolutely essential. We propose Shapley Value Explanation of Heterogeneous Neural Networks (SVEHNN) for explaining the Alzheimer’s diagnosis made by a DNN from the 3D point cloud of the neuroanatomy and tabular biomarkers. Our explanations are based on the Shapley value, which is the unique method that satisfies all fundamental axioms for local explanations previously established in the literature. Thus, SVEHNN has many desirable characteristics that previous work on interpretability for medical decision making is lacking. To avoid the exponential time complexity of the Shapley value, we propose to transform a given DNN into a Lightweight Probabilistic Deep Network without re-training, thus achieving a complexity only quadratic in the number of features. In our experiments on synthetic and real data, we show that we can closely approximate the exact Shapley value with a dramatically reduced runtime and can reveal the hidden knowledge the network has learned from the data.

To leverage the exponential time complexity of the Shapley value, it transforms a given DNN into a Lightweight Probabilistic Deep Network, eliminating the complexity from exponential time to quadratic time. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. This paper employs a solid theory, i.e., Shapley Value, for network explanation. Further, it gives an approximate manner to solve the high complexity. The topic is interesting and is of importance. The paper is also well organized and described. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The authors solely take the left hippocampus as the input of PointNet and do not describe the rationality. Fig. 2 and 3 are not well explained. From Fig. 2, we can just see that each biomarker has more than one Shapley values, but their specific meanings are not well described. For Fig. 3, how are these values (like +3.95, +1.44) computed?

Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance I guess it is a little difficult to re-implement the results because of the following reasons. The creation of the synthetic dataset in Section 3.1 is not introduced. The combination of the tabular data and the output of PointNet is ambiguous. The training details of the network, such as the optimizer, learning rate, are not described. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors.

While the assumption that inputs are independent normal distributions may be necessary for the math to work, it seems like locations in the hippocampus will not be independent. Figure 2 shows hippocampus Shapley values that greatly exceed those of the other biomarkers. There is no discussion of why this is the case. Figure 3 (left) is hard to interpret and has no description.. It is unclear what the outputs of the probabilistic neural network are and how they are used in computing the approximate Shapley value.

Some description of the Shapley sampling and Occlusion baselines should appear in the text to allow readers to understand the gains offered by the SVEHNN. The experiment section mentions 3 baseline approaches but only 2 are listed. Also it seems that the moving the point to the origin approach is not used. The range of Shapley values is unclear. Hippocampus values in figure 2 go to 15 while they only go to 1.5 in figure 3 right. This makes the clinical results hard to interpret.

<h1 id="abstract-id">Abstract</h1>
<p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have an enormous potential to learn from complex biomedical data. In particular, DNNs have been used to seamlessly fuse heterogeneous information from neuroanatomy, genetics, biomarkers, and neuropsychological tests for highly accurate Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis. On the other hand, their black-box nature is still a barrier for the adoption of such a system in the clinic, where interpretability is absolutely essential. We propose Shapley Value Explanation of Heterogeneous Neural Networks (SVEHNN) for explaining the Alzheimer’s diagnosis made by a DNN from the 3D point cloud of the neuroanatomy and tabular biomarkers. Our explanations are based on the Shapley value, which is the unique method that satisfies all fundamental axioms for local explanations previously established in the literature. Thus, SVEHNN has many desirable characteristics that previous work on interpretability for medical decision making is lacking. To avoid the exponential time complexity of the Shapley value, we propose to transform a given DNN into a Lightweight Probabilistic Deep Network without re-training, thus achieving a complexity only quadratic in the number of features. In our experiments on synthetic and real data, we show that we can closely approximate the exact Shapley value with a dramatically reduced runtime and can reveal the hidden knowledge the network has learned from the data.

      <p>This paper proposes a heterogeneous neural network based on Shapley Value for explaining the Alzheimer’s diagnosis made by DNN. To leverage the exponential time complexity of the Shapley value, it transforms a given DNN into a Lightweight Probabilistic Deep Network, eliminating the complexity from exponential time to quadratic time.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>As the method requires a good deal of computation, the authors should include timing information regarding the inference process.</p>

      <p>While the assumption that inputs are independent normal distributions may be necessary for the math to work, it seems like locations in the hippocampus will not be independent.</p>

      <p>Figure 2 shows hippocampus Shapley values that greatly exceed those of the other biomarkers. There is no discussion of why this is the case.</p>

      <p>Figure 3 (left) is hard to interpret and has no description..</p>

      <p>It is unclear what the outputs of the probabilistic neural network are and how they are used in computing the approximate Shapley value. For example, mu_k is not defined or well explained in the text and seems essential for calculating the expectation in (3).</p>

      <p>Some description of the Shapley sampling and Occlusion baselines should appear in the text to allow readers to understand the gains offered by the SVEHNN.</p>

      <p>The experiment section mentions 3 baseline approaches but only 2 are listed. Also it seems that the moving the point to the origin approach is not used.</p>

      <p>The range of Shapley values is unclear. Hippocampus values in figure 2 go to 15 while they only go to 1.5 in figure 3 right. This makes the clinical results hard to interpret.</p>

      <p>Validation of hippocampus shape classification as in figure 3 right should be shown for multiple patients to validate that the result is reproducible across patients.</p>

      <p>This paper proposes a heterogeneous neural network based on Shapley Value for explaining the Alzheimer’s diagnosis.</p>

      <p>The key strengths include:
1) it employs a solid theory, i.e., Shapley Value, for network explanation. 
2) it provides an approximate manner to solve the high complexity.</p>

      <p>The key weaknesses include:
1) Need more details on how the Shapley value approach coincides with clinical findings on ADNI.</p>

      <p>Based on all reviewers’ agreements, I would recommend accept this paper.</p>
